The prject has a zipped file with that contains both the code for the data 
collection and frontend with all the modules already installed and an already
configured Solr instance.  
If this option is not viable we have a README.md file in the folder "solr setup"
to set it up. The frontend is the homonymous folder and can be run with
`npm run dev` after installing the required modules.
