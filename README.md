CORRECTION on the report, the zipped file is too big to be uploaded on gitHub,
so please use a local instance of Solr and follow the README.md file in the folder "solr setup"
to crate a new core. The frontend is in the homonymous folder, after installing the required modules (`npm install`)
and can be run with `npm run dev`.
