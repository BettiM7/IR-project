Fox went there while the sun was still rising on the other side of the white rocks that rimmed the canyon and he found Bill's grave easily among the others. It was still covered with flowers. On the face of a tree stump the facts were inexpertly carved: Hickok's name, age, and the circumstances and date of his death. Fox had bathedat dawn, then awakened Wang Chee's wife to pick up his clean, starched clothes at their laundry. It felt good to be scrubbed, shaved, and clad in a ticking-stripe shirt and faded blue pants that smelled of sunshine, soap, and the hot breath of Mrs. Chee's iron. Although he always felt a pang of longing when he thought of the Lakota, this was where he belonged. Even with its glaring flaws and inconsistencies, Deadwood was home, and he had returned with a new sense of his own worth. Maybe he was flawed, too, but he still had a purpose\u2014and it felt good to know that again."

Neither ship would usually see the other, as they would be attacked and destroyed at a distance of hundreds of thousands of kilometers. With advances in electronic warfare in the middle of the twenty-first century, the ability to strike at long-range became more and more difficult. The battles soon changed to the great battleship duels of the Great War and the carrier battles and ship skirmishes ofthe Great Uprising. Looking to the future, all hopes rested on the idea of the universal ship design, with a mixture of weapons, armor, defensive systems, and embarked fighters. Events in the Orion Nebula would put this idea to the test. Naval Cadet's Handbook The training scenario on board the Alliance warship was not the most well prepared that Jack had ever seen. Since the news that the entire regiment was to be shipped out, they had been practicing a great variety of different missions, and this was the fourth in the last fortnight."

It felt like only minutes passed between my head hitting the pillow and someone shaking my shoulder. I came to consciousness thickly and cracked open a groggy eye to see Jannie and Ali standing by my bed, dressed for the morning jog I'd promised them. I could feel the heat of Bree's body behind me, and not wanting to wake her, I held a finger to my lips. They nodded and crept out of the room. I got up, feeling a little dizzy and wanting three, maybe four more hours of sleep. But these days a promise to my kids was a promise I tried to keep. I got dressed in the closet and eased out of the room, smelling coffee brewing downstairs. I went to the kitchen, where Nana Mama, in her navy-blue nightgown and robe, was already pouring me a small cup of coffee. Jannie and Ali were tying their shoelaces. \u201cBless you,\u201d"

According to Henry, the leader of the French embassy, Gabriel de Grammont, Bishop of Tarbes, had voiced doubts about Mary's legitimacy, and although the King had been able to reassure him that Pope Julius had issued a dispensation for his marriage to Katherine, he was not sure that it was valid in canon law. Henry unburdened himself to Wolsey. The Cardinal, foreseeing a solution to the succession dilemma in a French marriage for his master, convened with Archbishop Warham an ecclesiastical court to examine the King's doubts; it met in secret at Westminster on 17 May. Meanwhile, Mary was sent with her household to Hunsdon, and Henry toyed with the idea of making his son Richmond King of Ireland, so as to make him a more desirable match for Maria of Portugal, Charles V's niece. Suspecting that this might also be a preliminary to him naming the boy his heir, the Queen made very plain her disapproval."

Staring at the scenery his eyes invented out of textured ceiling, out the window where gorgeous creatures reclined in cloud, he would catch his hands pulling and twisting at a candy wrapper, a hen-scratched Post It, a sheet of lost and yellowing stationery, until at last the first glimmer of bird came through. He hadno inkling of the long traditions of paper folding. He knew far less than his hands knew: of bending, pressing, worrying free the shape poised for flight out of garbage. And when he ran out of garbage he made birds out of the grim chronicles of neglect, disease, and grief salvaged from these long-dead patients' files. That first paper bird had been a strange thing: wings with the shattered angles of lightning, beak a twisted black tear. Over the years the shapes refined: at times almost delicate in the ways the multiple-creased necks reached up to support the complicated heads, at times unsoundly fantastic as paper stub wings evolved into great wavering flyleaves of actuarial data ready to take the sad facts of a life and journey south over some dark and troubled continent to the nesting grounds along the far edge of where we all came from."

There were bowls of home-grown vegetables in the center of the table displayed with flair. All surfaces were scrubbed and polished and smelled of lemon.

And of course Shaz's mum is constantly rushing off in the middle of the night and delivering triplets who've got stuck. My mum's job was so dull that I never had anything to boast about. But that day she was a total and utter star. By the time she got changed, there were five reporters and three photographers standing on the pavement outside. \u2018If I know that Donna, she'll have given an exclusive to the highest bidder,' she said, \u2018which is good news for us, girls, because all the other papers will be out to trash her.

She never imagined she would end up back in her sleepy New Hampshire hometown, living in the house she grew up in, and taking over her father's beekeeping business. Lily Campanello is familiar with do-overs, too. When she and her mom relocate to Adams, New Hampshire, for her final year of high school, they both hope it will be a fresh start. And for just a short while, these new beginnings are exactly what Olivia and Lily need. Their paths cross when Asher falls for the new girl in school, and Lily can't help but fall for him, too. With Ash, she feels happy for the first time. Yet at times, she wonders if she can she trust him completely . . . Then one day, Olivia receives a phone call: Lily is dead, and Asher is being questioned by the police. Olivia is adamant that her son is innocent. But she would be lying if she didn't acknowledge the flashes of his father's temper in him, and as the case against him unfolds, she realizes he's hidden more than he's shared with her. Mad Honey is a riveting novel of suspense, an unforgettable love story, and a moving and powerful exploration of the secrets we keep and the risks we take in order to become ourselves."

Isabella turned and glanced at her sideways. \u201cHow did you know?\u201dSusa smiled and looked superior, mixing gelatin into the whipping cream as a stiffener, preparing for the fabulous desserts she would be concocting that evening. Very casually, she shrugged. \u201cI know many things. \u201dSusa was like a member of the family. After Isabella's mother died, it was Susa she often turned to for those familiar motherly things that she needed. Itwas Susa who taught her how to act with the customers, how to say, \u201cPlease,\u201d and, \u201cThank you,\u201d and look as if you meant it. When Luca was putting her into jeans and plaid shirts as though she were a little boy, Susa taught her how to wear frilly dresses. She had a lot to thank the woman for. But Susa could be annoying, all the same. Just like family. Her silver hair was set in neat curls around her head, augmented by tortoiseshell combs. She looked ageless and infinitely efficient, which was just exactly what she was."

It was Paul, the author of a popular syndicated style and fashion column, who had suggested an article on Ladybug Farm to his friend, an editor at Virginians at Home. The idea had been met with initial resistance from the members of the household who actually knew what it would take to prepare the old house for a photo session. But they had eventually been worn down, if not entirely overruled, by Lori."

The contest between power via intimidation and freedom to cooperate voluntarily continues in the 9/11 era. My book is fiction but terrorism is real, affecting citizens of every nation. For open societies like ours, peaceful coexistence vs. the need for safety requires constant vigilance. Live-and-let-live philosophy works where groups livein relative harmony, not attempting to destroy one another. With the remarkable technology of modern warfare, no person or place is safe from harm. Any nation's capital is a strategic target for attacks, so people living near Washington, D. C. recognize their particular vulnerability. Just such a suburb is McLean, Virginia. All countries, cultures, societies and religions incorporate the full range of human behavior: kind and cruel, war-like or peace-loving, close-minded or open-minded, progressive or regressive and so on."

And as if that one phrase weren't shocking enough, Robert added another. \u201cAnd I want you to take my place. \u201d\u201cSurely you're not ready to stop working yet,\u201d Theo managed to reply, not attempting to hide his astonishment to the man who was not yet sixty. His dark eyebrows shot up over startled blue eyes. \u201cYou have years left to offer the bank and the people of Bozeman. And on top of that, I'm not ready to assume full control of this establishment. \u201d He perched on the edge of his seat, hands clenched into fists as though to protest the statements."

The award is bestowed by Australian independent booksellers, who clearly have excellent taste. Girt was also shortlisted for the 2014 Australian Book Industry Awards (ABIA), the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, the Australian Book Design Awards and was the only non-fiction bookshortlisted for the ABA Nielsen BookData 2014 Booksellers Choice Award. Girt is four parts narrative Australian history and one part satire, mixed in the cultural melting pot, stirred with the wooden spoon of schadenfreude, and garnished with the crushed stems of tall poppies. True Girt, volume 2 of The Unauthorised History of Australia, was published in 2016 and shortlisted for Audiobook of the Year at the 2017 ABIAs and for the Russell Prize for Humour Writing . David's first children's picture book, The Nose Pixies, was also published in 2016. It is illustrated by the award-winning Lucia Masciullo. The Nose Pixies is a tale of a father's love, a son's nose picking and the bedtime story that cured him of his habit. David's second picture book with Lucia Masciulo, My Real Friend, is about friendship and the existential angst of being an imaginary friend. David has a birthmark that looks like Tasmania, only smaller and not as far south."

        "description": "Zero Fail builds a case for the reader to help understand the current state of the Secret Service through a handful of stories from agents and other former staff who worked in close proximity to Presidents - starting with JFK. Some of her longer and more detailed chapters are simply more detailed because of her own deep reporting and intimate knowledge on specific subjects. Though she lacks detail on other more important matters and gets only a few small facts slightly off but for the average reader these facts are not important. This powerful book shows an organization that continues to succeed increasingly with luck rather than tried, true and continually improved upon protocols and a front-line workforce driven to succeed in light of managers who've sold out and opt to make decisions based on their own career goals instead of the agency and mission long-term needs. The issue of insufficient fiscal funding is continually addressed throughout the book. In the end, the two big themes your left with are the agency needs more money and to accede the fact the promotion system to the upper echelons is too insular in its approach being based almost predominantly on family lineage and friendship instead of the most qualified individual for the moment leading to a Lord of the Flies environment when favorites are not at the helm. At the end of the book the author offers key insights into how this protection organization tasked with being sentinels of democracy appears to have been guided by several named senior managers who appear to have let their own views or those of their friends guide them to put the core of the mission second to politics. It is the best read for anyone seeking to better understand an agency whose men and women often work in the shadows of the spotlight."

He had heard good reports of his grandson's prowess, the old man told them both, but he had never seen him fight, and so he wanted to watch him pit himself against Lochmaben's best and to draw his own conclusions."

She didn't care. It anchored her to the present, reminding her why she hadn't left this small town and the troubling memories it held from her childhood. Memories courtesy of the person locked up over one hundred miles away- though not anymore. Her chest squeezed. He wasn't locked up anymore. \u201cMeredith!\u201dThe snap in Sheane's voice jerked her out of a spiral of panic.

Who laughs out loud when they're doing a barbell squat? I did, the book was LOL funny, heart warming, devastating and redemptive. Bravo to The Author Brent Weeks and narrator Simon Vance. So what's next for you? You've taken me on 2 fun journeys and I'm looking forward to your next series!===The first 2/3 of the book was great butwhat a disappointing ending to what could have been a brilliant series. There were few character arch's that were resolved and sadly the last 1/3 of the book was a mostly a flop - it felt like it was written by a completely different author; no continuity or respect for the rules of the magic system so well developed in the first 4 books; the characters flippantly changed in their personalities and moral standing; there were story lines that went nowhere or didn't reach their full potential; too many newly introduced and under developed concepts for the sake of the narrative or as 'plot twists'; and so many other issues I won't go into because of spoilers. The additional online content \"the real ending\" (I can't remember the other chapters name) was the nail in the coffin for me, I know it was tongue in cheek but it was so uncomfortable to read and just rubbish. It felt like a slap in the face validating how lacking in integrity the in-book ending was. I do not recommending reading the online 'ending'."

        "description": "This is quite dark, and I think it would be perfect for fall/Halloween reading lists. I picked it up because I was intrigued by the \"puritanical\" society and because I've not read very many witch stories. My mother didn't allow me to engage with anything with witches in/on it when I was growing up, so you can see why this one might appeal to me as an adult. I grew up in a very conservative and religious household and would consider my childhood church fundamentalist. The way this society is setup with The Prophet being the ultra-revered religious and civic leader with total power over everyone in the town of Bethel, especially the women. . . I mean, I feel certain parts of this story deeply. In a lot of ways, I feel SEEN. So anyway, this story definitely has a creep factor. The witches that live in the forbidden Darkwood forest are terrifying and incredibly powerful. There's this sense of dread that hangs over you while you're reading, and I found that both delicious and a little bit scary. Emmanuelle is a great character that carries a lot of weight and baggage in this story, and I really had no idea how things would end up. There are these wonderful nods to Salem and other places of long ago with the pyres and fires, and the patriarchal cult-like society totally gave me the creeps. It reminded me a lot of The Scarlet Letter and M. Night Shyamalan's movie The Village. One thing I particular that I loved is that there is 100% a historical feel to the story in terms of clothing and lack of amenities, but I sometimes think these religious/cult-type stories give me a contemporary vibe too. This is certainly the case here and I was excited to hear the author mention on a podcast interview that there may be more stories featuring Emmanuelle and this world in the future."

I'd recommend looking for a review from someone who is more experienced with reading horror than me to get an accurate picture of where this stands in the genre. However, I appreciated the set pieces for the horror scenes here and when the build up finally came to a crescendo it was dramatic and satisfying. This book is divided into three sections and section two in particular drags quite a bit and it took me a long time to get into. Section three was my favorite and the only time the pacing felt right on point."

To fall on \u2018a\u2018a lava is to rip through denim and lacerate skin. \u2018A\u2018a flows, even when cool, are best avoided. I am avoiding them now, too weak with fever to explore, moving in and out of sleep with no sense of time, fighting a virus that appeared out of nowhere. I share the fever and the bed with my companion, her body as feverish as mine."

When a woman slides into his DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and break up. Their curses will cancel each other's out, and they'll both go on to find the love of their lives. It's a bonkers idea\u2026 and it just might work. Emma hadn't planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse wouldbe in Minnesota, but she and her best friend agree that dating Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially when they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka. It's supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer. But when Emma's toxic mother shows up and Justin has to assume guardianship of his three siblings, they're suddenly navigating a lot more than they expected\u2013including catching real feelings for each other. What if this time Fate has actually brought the perfect pair together?"

Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold a historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and she sees little choice but to surrender herselfin the exchange\u2014again. . . Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It's clear from the way he tracks Misery's every movement that he doesn't trust her. If only he knew how right he was\u2026. Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what's hers, even if it means a life alone in Were territory\u2026alone with the wolf."

Sometimes their play had spun on long after sundown, and they'd hidden from her parents' calls in the long grasses. Leigh stopped at the water's edge and looked back toward the road. She could almost see their two heads, one dark and the other blond, peering through the sea grass.

        "description": "This is quite possibly one of my top 5 favorite books this year. It was my first experience with Ruta Sepetys' writing, and I immediately fell in love. Known for being a cross over writer, Sepetys is quickly becoming a new favorite with a beautiful blend of YA, historical fiction, and an edge of mystery. This story is told from multiple perspectives- all of varying backgrounds. The intricately woven connections between the hotel maid, young American photographer, cousin working in an Adoption Centre, and a rough around the edges cousin were so poignantly developed- I devoured this book in a weekend. I loved learning about Spanish history through the eyes of young adults- one of wealth, and one of poverty- and I loved the suspense that was balanced with a forbidden friendship, all leading to an ending that had me pulling out the box of tissues. ===Another excellent historical fiction novel from Ruta Sepetys! I'm a bit embarrassed by how little I know about Spain during the time Franco ruled. This novel touched my heart as well helped begin my education about Spain and Franco. Although this is marketed as a young adult novel, to me it is a terrific choice for adult readers who love historical fiction. ===This book was just okay. I am a little disappointed, I had been waiting to read this book with great expectations, since it deals with the story of my own country. What I liked about it is that some aspects of the dictatorship were well-developed, but I found myself strongly disliking Daniel, which made it difficult for me to read. I wish I could've become more attached to the characters, surely I would've enjoyed it more!"

Still, his time in the palace was not wasted. He did find more hellkind. Within days Calto dispatched three additional hellhounds and almost lost his arm to a demon before managing to shove his blessed staff down its throat while the hellborn tore off the shreds of Calto's armor. Afterward, a number of the servitors mysteriously disappeared. Calto was about to send a missive to his brethren about the need for a purge when the king, roused from his stupor, ordered him to leave the castle immediately. Even so, if he had not had such troubling dreams about Simta, mainly that she was being devoured by cats, Calto would have defied the king's order and stayed longer, making sure to take care of Elise's two problems in a permanent fashion once he found them."

Now the day of the competition had arrived, and Mr. Desper, our school's director of public relations, personally drove Andy Babington and me to a football stadium in Santa Monica. Andy sat in the front. Fox Sports had set upcameras and tents and interview stations around the field, and it was a typical gorgeous clear California afternoon. Babington had several buddies in attendance but I didn't. While he talked and joked with the other alpha males, I sat by myself and stewed. What was I going to do? I hadn't really thrown a football in two months, but I could now probably chuck it across town. Thanks to the bizarre disease I could win this competition easily and break all the records and get myself on every television set in America."

Each morning that week the fog was so thick that it blocked out the sun until noon\u2026 or one\u2026 or five. But each time Artie pulled one of his old gowns out of the trunk he could almost feel the heat of the spotlights again and the warmth of the loving crowds. Tim kept busy too. He worked at Arts every night that week and worked on his kitchen floor during the daytime. The first sanding exposed the tiny nails in thehardwood floors. Now he gave each one a tap with the hammer and a little steel tool that looked like an awl\u2014exactly the way Nick taught him. On Saturday Nick drove down from Monte Rio and they spent the afternoon filling the tiny holes with wood putty. They tuned in a classical station and didn't talk much. Tim's back ached and he hadn't mentioned his mother once since Aunt Ruth called on Sunday from the Wagon Wheel Inn. Nick was frustrated that Tim wouldn't confide in him and he couldn't remember the last time they spent a Saturday night without sex."

On the north circuit, topless towers soared above the highest rampart. From the walls, from the towers, had come a lethal rain of arrows, spears, rocks, and boiling oil, with sacks of excrement thrown in for comic relief. It seemed the Dardanians had an endless supply of war materiel and that no siege, however long, would exhaust their stores. For two long years now, the Arkadian armies had tried to breach those angled walls, to scale them, to undermine them. Frustrated eyes had long beheld those towers, and tired, defeated minds had imagined them ablaze, destroyed for all time, their rain of death ended. But not yet. The siege went on endlessly, and so did the single-combat contests. Dauntless heroes from each side had locked in mortal combat, one on one. Victories had gone to both sides. In this respect the score was about even. But Dardanians were winning the siege, wearing down the Arkadian attackers."

It was never good, no matter how I practiced telling him. What if he thought I was with him only for money? What if he despised me for being dishonest with him in the first place? I couldn't bear the thought of seeing anything in his eyes other than the adoration I see now for me when I look into them. I would love Aaron if he was dirt poor, but I doubt I could convince him of that after I asked him for so much money. I scratched that option off the list. The next option was to scrape the money together myself. I calculated how much money I actually had in my head. I had about two thousand in my savings and if I tapped into my 401K, I could get another five maybe after taxes."

Based on other reviews, if you loved The Whisper Man, you might not like this. But if you were underwhelmed by it, I recommend you give this a try. ===I thoroughly enjoyed this story. It hit all the marks for horror. It was creepy and in certain parts chilling and unexpected. I loved the way this was told through different timelines and different perspectives. The transitions always felt seamless. My favorite part of the book was the big twist at the beginning of part 3. I definitely didn't see that coming. It actually made me a bit emotional. My big problem was the ending. It was all over the place and pretty messy. Which is a shame I was hoping for more of an impact at the end?However, all that said it was still a solid read."

But it's the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans; the lonely, brilliant, Nobel\u2013prize-nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with\u2014of all things\u2014her mind. True chemistry results. But like science, life is unpredictable. Which is why a fewyears later Elizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother but the reluctant star of America's most beloved cooking show Supper at Six. Elizabeth's unusual approach to cooking (\u201ccombine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride\u201d) proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn't just teaching women to cook. She's daring them to change the status quo. Laugh-out-loud funny, shrewdly observant, and studded with a dazzling cast of supporting characters, Lessons in Chemistry is as original and vibrant as its protagonist."

That's how completely he's captured everyone's attention. He steps to the window with a commanding presence, and the rest of the class falls back. At this point the sparrow is fluttering its wings hysterically against the glass. The boy reaches out with his bare hands and gently cups them around the terrified creature.

On the other hand I was no longer faced with the onerous task of maintaining good behavior, especially toward the end of the year when I expected Santa would be paying attention.

They had both attended the Virginia Military Institute together as young men, and before that, they had known one another. Even their families went back several generations; their great-great grandfathers had conducted business together. That was the mark of something that went deeper than friendship. That was the mark of two true-blooded American families. They were both steeped in the South and bathed in loyalty. Each knew that the other's word was steel. He looked forward to seeing Davis. So, when his friend, the esteemed state senator from the panhandle of Florida called him to say that something big was in the works, Colonel Winston Grisham, U. S. Marines (retired) listened. He had told his wife to have the cooks prepare an early supper for his friend's arrival: a good, southern meal."

We perceive the world via our senses, focus on the important elements of it, and act accordingly. Many may think what we perceive in our heads is a 100 percent accurate representation of the world as it is, as if the eyes and ears and the rest are essentially passive recording systems, receiving information and passing it on to the brain, which sorts it and organizes it and sends it to the relevant places, like a pilot checking the instruments."

There were wide double doors that opened onto a large patio area where folks with both wheelchairs and walkers could enjoy the outdoors. Julia remembered sitting on that very patio many times. At first, it had been the only place where they could bring Jasper to see Henry. Henry had made significant progress after he had spent some time with his old furry friend, and he and Brinn had spent many afternoons just sitting and enjoying each others' company. Eventually the hospital had recognized the health benefits that Jasper's visits brought, and Jasper was allowed into Henry's room. Although never formally certified as a therapy dog, Jasper had certainly proved very therapeutic for Henry and for Brinn."

Ow!\u201d It was horrible\u2014an almost-human cry of distress, more like a hoarse wail than a canine howl. The sound came from one of the examining rooms, but it was loud enough to reverberate through the hall. I could hear the voice as clearly as I'd heard Doc Sharpe. To the white-haired vet, it was probably just so much barking. Still, he paused, raising a hand to stop what he figured would be my continued protestations."

If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them?But it's all just for show, of course, because there's no way Daphne would actually start her new chapter by falling in love with her ex-fianc\u00e9's new fianc\u00e9e's ex\u2026right?"

They soared between snow-capped peaks, Ehrgraz keeping them lower to the ground, Cyrus expected, where the air was thick enough for him to breathe. He had been higher, once, and recalled well the thinness of the air. When they came out of the mountains, the foothills ended shortly, dipping into the thick, lush Jungle of Vidara and then spreading out into the long, loping Gradsden Savanna. At the far end of the jungle, Cyrus could see the glimmering of a mighty lake reflecting sunlight, and beyond that, mountain peaks even higher than the ones he'd just passed. Cyrus stared down at the flatlands. From up here, the grass didn't seem nearly so high. He caught sight of one of the portals, though he wasn't sure if it was the one they had traveled from to get to Amti."

If Bonnie had to estimate, she'd be forced to say she was reserving less than twelve percent of her attention for Armen. The rest she gave over to the impressive maypole which towered over them all in the Griffith's front yard. Here she sat at a long picnic table sharing corn bread and watermelon with a slew of witches, and truth be told she felt right at home. She'd had very little to do with the maypole's creation. That was the work of Rhiannon, Ali, Jesse, Winston, and those witches whose names she knew she could bring to the forefront of her brain if she cared enough to try. Still, something magical had transpired in the weaving of the long rib-bons. Then there'd been the singing, welcoming the goddess back from her long winter's repose, asking for her blessing on the coming year."

Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself\u2014and his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the backyard is a locked shed from which strange sounds emerge, as if some creature is trying to escape. When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie the house, a massive amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is impossible to believe, and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to shoulder. Because within the shed is a portal to another world\u2014one whose denizens are in peril and whose monstrous leaders may destroy their own world, and ours. In this parallel universe, where two moons race across the sky, and the grand towers of a sprawling palace pierce the clouds, there are exiled princesses and princes who suffer horrific punishments; there are dungeons; there are games in which men and women must fight each other to the death for the amusement of the \u201cFair One. \u201d And there is a magic sundial that can turn back time. A story as old as myth, and as startling and iconic as the rest of King's work, Fairy Tale is about an ordinary guy forced into the hero's role by circumstance, and it is both spectacularly suspenseful and satisfying."

        "description": "\u201cAt precisely twelve-thirty the grandfather clock in the downstairs hallway would dong, which signaled that dinner was on the table. The children would come in from the front yard, the men would rise up from the rockers on the porch, and we would make our way in to the feast. Except on the last Sunday of the month, which was when we had to stay after church for the monthly business meeting. On that day, we ate cold meat loaf sandwiches left over from my grandmother's Saturday night meat loaf. The cold meat loaf sandwiches were the highlight of the day. I'd put ketchup on mine and squish the bread flat around the meat, then dip it in ketchup again to ease the dryness. The business meetings were long and tedious, chock-full of detailed reports on trifling matters. The meeting would begin with a devotional thought from Bob Miles Sr. , former editor of The Harmony Herald and teacher of the Live Free or Die Sunday school class. Bob Sr. would begin by recalling how much of the week he'd spent in earnest prayer, seeking God's counsel on what message he might bring."

I personally don't care for the show but still really enjoyed this book about a plus-size fashion blogger who becomes the star of a reality show called \u201cMain Squeeze\u201d which is similar to The Bachelor. This is a great poolside read and easy to get lost in. I liked the body positivity and the perspective of what it's like to be in plus size and the expectations society pushes on women. I also liked how the book had a mix of stories, episodes, podcasts, texts, emails, etc. I thought it made the format fun to read. A super cute rom-com with light steam and closed-door romance. ======I burnt myself out on horror and thriller novels and I don't typically read things like this anymore. It was everything I needed! Its light-hearted fun brain-fluff. I really loved the premise of the dating show (most dating shows are a guilty pleasure for me, but I have never watched an episode of the Bachelor/ette in its entirety). It made for an awesome fun-factor. I also loved Allison, Marin, and the final three of men. My setback here is honestly Bea. There were scenes where I just flat-out didn't like her, honestly. I didn't like how she would present as such a self-assured individual but be nasty and honestly almost aggressive when her insecurities would take over. I liked Bea at the end better than any other version of her."

It was an orderly camp; that argued for a group that fought together regularly, with one man commander over the rest. They traveled lightly, no animals, one pack each, and their weapons. They camped properly, arranged around the fire, pine boughs and bracken over the boughs laid out to keep them off the snow. The fire had been well made in a scrape, so that melting snow didn't overwhelm it and put it out. They thought they were alone in the wilderness, roasting their stolen sheep, counting over their loot. Which was, all things considered, not much; they'd managed to find one poor peddler and had raided a single farmstead. It scarcely seemed worth the effort. They were bold, or desperate, to be making raids on her father's lands this deep in winter. Unless, of course, they were scouts for a larger force."

All we knew for sure was that we wanted to get out of the territory. And maybe that was enough for now.

        "description": "The Crimson Witch had an interesting concept and was set in a magical world however it fell short on keeping me hooked. While there was twists throughout, I did not feel on edge too much because I felt the danger element was missing due to the way the characters could heal and regenerate. I understand this is just a part of the creatures in the world, so this is just a personal opinion, the fighting scenes were still written well. I did not like the characters too much, some were cool, but most had the same kind of personality and felt flat. The way the sister's relationship changed over time was good though and you can see the character development starting to build from this. The plot was good and carried an interesting story with parts of the world's history sprinkled in at moments creating a deeper sense to the world. The world itself was interesting however I felt it could have been more established in the beginning. It would probably take me another book to fully wrap my head around the tattoos and different lands but that is not too surprising for a fantasy book as new worlds are always a little confusing. Would I read a sequel? The end left it on a cliff-hanger that was quite exciting. We met a character that was mentioned throughout the book and they seem like they could create a fast-paced exciting story. The writing style was good, and I would probably want to see how North's writing developed from this one to the next therefore, I may be interested in reading a sequel, if and when it came about."

Leeza was the youngest of the five victims. A few years out of high school, she was working at the Misty Nights Bar & Grill to put herself through college. Her eyes blazed with life, he thought, flipping through the other pictures in his file. Terror consumed her in one of the photos that had been sent to the AllNews Press Agency. Again Tanner's gut tightened at the indignity. It had been nearly two days since Mark Harding had alerted them to the letter. In that time the task force had held several case status meetings. It was now 9:00 p. m. The ANPA had been calling Tanner every thirty minutes, demanding confirmation so they could run their story. Tanner was leading the group's last meeting before the task force would respond, aware that they'd already missed the agreed upon deadline with the newswire service."

He asked me my programme for the next few days and released me just after 11. 00 p. m. I took a taxi back to my car which was alone in the street. I walked across to the gardien who was sleeping by the chained entrance to the car park and asked him if he'd seen anybody and he told me he'd already been asked that and his answer was the same as the last time. The girl in reception gave me a fax from Martin Fall and another from the hospital asking me to visit Rademakers in the morning. I asked about flights to Korhogo and she looked it up in her book and told me the published departure time was 10. 00 a. m. She pointed across the lobby to Bagado who was sleeping across three seats, still wearing his blue mac. The dab of white on his hair seemed a bit stronger\u2014Bagado ageing by the week. I booked him in and asked her if Malahide was still in the hotel and she went back to that book of hers and said he'd left after lunch that day."

Since she's been fully conscious and her vital signs and test numbers have stayed normal, they release her with a warning not to overdo things. As her parents and Noelle drive Mackie back to the island, she sends me a message from her mother's phone: Meet me, 1 hour! My house!I give it forty-five minutes and run to the Spences'home. When he sees me, Gus bumps his nose against the front window and wags his propeller of a tail. I wait on the porch swing until the Spences' car turns into their drive. Mackie opens the car door and stands. She looks fine. Better than fine . . . great!In five running steps I hold her in a hug. When she puts her head on my chest and wraps her arms around me, I have never felt so relieved. \u201cMackie, you go ahead now. It's cold out here,\u201d Mr. Spence scolds. Mackie smiles and takes my hand as we walk into the house."
