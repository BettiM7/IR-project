The third edition takes a balanced approach to the theory and application of microeconomics concepts. The text uses conversational language and ample illustrations to explore economic theories, and provides a wide array of examples using both fictional and real-world applications. The third edition has been carefully and thoroughly updated to reflect recent developments, as well as to provide a deeper background in diverse contributors and their impacts on economic thought and analysis. For example, the third edition highlights the research and views of a broader group of economists. A fuller list of changes made in Principles of Microeconomics 3e are described in the preface and the transition guide to help instructors transition to the third edition. The second edition of Principles of Microeconomics by OpenStax is available in web view here. OpenStax is retiring Principles of Microeconomics and Principles of Macroeconomics for AP 2e textbooks because they are outdated. We recommend that Advanced Placement instructors and students use the college-level textbooks.",
