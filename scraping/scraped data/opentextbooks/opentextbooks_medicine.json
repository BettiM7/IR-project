National reports, including the Trust for America’s Health annual report State of Obesity: Better Policies for a Healthier America, highlight key findings and policy recommendations. The need to continue to work towards stabilization of the obesity epidemic could not be more important as consequences of this chronic disease can be dire, potentially affecting physical health with an increase in risk for chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and several types of cancer as well as potentially affecting behavioral health. Curbing the high rates of obesity is particularly of importance when considering the prevalence of childhood obesity, which is on the rise not only in the United States but is also increasing globally. Although there are certain risk factors such as genetics that are not modifiable in this group, there are many dietary, physical activity and environmental factors that are modifiable through lifestyle changes. This course will explore ways to address these lifestyle changes for children through adults with both federally- and NGO- based community interventions that are working towards combating overweight and obesity and how they aim to do so with a health equity lens in mind.",

The resource introduces students to body measurements, but does so in an inclusive manner. This resource is a unique contribution to nursing education as content is theoretically informed by an inclusive approach to assessment that incorporates culturallyresponsive techniques related to race/ethnicity, gender/sex/ sexual orientation, body sizes/types, and ability/disability. It is part of the first health assessment resource that is informed by clinical judgment with the goal to facilitate students’ clinical decision making and ability to prioritize care by recognizing and acting on cues and signs of clinical deterioration. Interactive clinical judgment activities and formative assessments to evaluate a student’s learning are integrated throughout the resource. The integration of clinical judgment throughout this resource will support students’ capacity to enhance patient safety and equitable health outcomes as well as their success in writing national nursing exams to become licensed to work as a Nurse.",

        "description": "En el nuevo contexto globalizado, el campo laboral abarca múltiples áreas en las que se desenvuelven trabajadores que aportan la producción y generan ingresos a la economía de un país, en este contexto, es imprescindible proteger la integridad de los obreros que están día a día expuestos a diversas situaciones que pueden generar desde leves hasta graves problemas en su integridad física y en su salud en general. La Identificación de peligros y evaluación de riesgos, permite elaborar las medidas de prevención para precautelar la integridad de los trabajadores dentro de cada empresa dependiendo de su área de competencia. Ya que pueden sufrir accidentes, lesiones físicas, enfermedades ocupaciones que deterioran la calidad de vida de las personas. Según la Organización Internacional del Trabajo OIT, a nivel mundial al menos 108.000 trabajadores mueren en su lugar de trabajo cada año. Datos de países industrializados muestran que los trabajadores de la construcción tienen una probabilidad entre 3 y 4 veces mayor de morir a causa de accidentes en el trabajo que otros trabajadores. Con estos antecedentes, en el mundo se han creado medidas de precaución de trabajo para la disminución de accidentes, implantando normativas internacionales. Diseñar e implementar un sistema de gestión de seguridad y salud ocupacional basada en normas internacionales permite transformar los entornos laborales en ambientes más amigables y productivos en las empresas. Se considera imprescindible proteger al personal, a través de la implementación de procesos de Seguridad y Salud Ocupacional, enmarcados en los requisitos legales aplicables a cada país, la capacitación, adquisición de herramientas y equipos adecuados, además de tener acceso a servicios de atención de salud, permitirán optimizar la eficiencia de su labor en todas las áreas laborales.",

Además, frente a una lucha contra el cambio climático por efecto de la ganadería, una de las principales estrategias para la mitigación de gases de efecto invernadero, lo constituyen alternativas sostenibles si uso de productos con alta huella de carbono, revalorizando, además, los recursos locales. En el caso de la zona norte de Ecuador, a pesar de los limitados atributos respecto a gradiente de fertilidad de los suelos, la cría de ganado ya sea de leche y/o doble propósito representa uno de los eslabones más fuertes dentro de la economía de las familias. Por lo tanto, es menester investigar alternativas de producción que nos permitan conservar los recursos naturales dada la fragilidad de estos ecosistemas megadiversos. Mediante este libro se plasma que el uso de sistemas ganaderos convencionales, degradan los recursos naturales con mermas significativas de la productividad, así como bajo réditos económicos. En consecuencia, la implementación de sistemas silvopastoriles como alternativa tecnológica de fácil instalación, es sin duda el camino para alcanzar sistemas ganaderos más eficientes, amigables con el medio ambiente, diversificando además los ingresos económicos de la población.",

Descriptions of the detailed procedures and methods used in trials that have been conducted in the past have generally not been published. As a consequence, those planning such trials have few guidelines available and little access to previously accumulated knowledge. In this book the practical issues of trial design and conduct are discussed fully and in sufficient detail for the text to be used as a “toolbox” by field investigators. The toolbox has now been extensively tested through use of the first two editions and this third edition is a comprehensive revision, incorporating the many developments that have taken place with respect to trials since 1996 and involving more than 30 contributors. Most of the chapters have been extensively revised and 7 new chapters have been added.",

        "description": "Introducing public health ethics poses two special challenges. First, it is a relatively new field that combines public health and practical ethics. Its unfamiliarity requires considerable explanation, yet its scope and emergent qualities make delineation difficult. Moreover, while the early development of public health ethics occurred in a western context, its reach, like public health itself, has become global. A second challenge, then, is to articulate an approach specific enough to provide clear guidance yet sufficiently flexible and encompassing to adapt to global contexts. Broadly speaking, public health ethics helps guide practical decisions affecting population or community health based on scientific evidence and in accordance with accepted values and standards of right and wrong. In these ways, public health ethics builds on its parent disciplines of public health and ethics. This dual inheritance plays out in the definition the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers of public health ethics: “A systematic process to clarify, prioritize, and justify possible courses of public health action based on ethical principles, values and beliefs of stakeholders, and scientific and other information” (CDC 2011). Public health ethics shares with other fields of practical and professional ethics both the general theories of ethics and a common store of ethical principles, values, and beliefs. It differs from these other fields largely in the nature of challenges that public health officials typically encounter and in the ethical frameworks it employs to address these challenges. Frameworks provide methodical approaches or procedures that tailor general ethical theories, principles, values, and beliefs to the specific ethical challenges that arise in a particular field. Although no framework is definitive, many are useful, and some are especially effective in particular contexts. This chapter will conclude by setting forth a straightforward, stepwise ethics framework that provides a tool for analyzing the cases in this volume and, more importantly, one that public health practitioners have found useful in a range of contexts. For a public health practitioner, knowing how to employ an ethics framework to address a range of ethical challenges in public health—a know-how that depends on practice—is the ultimate take-home message.",

What many encounter is difficulty in applying their knowledge to a clinical setting.Applied Human Anatomywas created to better integrate material that is more often than not treated separately in contemporary health care curricula. It is hoped that through this integration students will develop a deeper and more lasting knowledge and understanding of human anatomy as they are likely to need it in the evaluation and management of patients.",

        "description": "Ultrasound has a wide range of medical applications. Some of these include obstetrics (monitoring the progress of pregnancy), oncology (monitoring the growth of tumors), cardiology (visualizing the heart function and physiology), biopsy (guiding needles in various procedures), and physiotherapy. For example, today, an estimated 60-70% of pregnant women in the United States undergo ultrasound examination during pregnancy. An estimated 250 million fetal ultrasound examinations are performed every year in the USA. In the last few decades, ultrasound technology has expanded to medical imaging in various other specialties: Anesthesiology, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, General Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB-GYN), Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Physiatry, Sports Medicine, and Surgery. The increasing demand in the use of ultrasound technology in various biomedical fields points to a future in which medical professionals will be required to possess a general knowledge of ultrasound technology. While currently most medical professionals rely on technicians to perform the imaging studies, there can be a high degree of operator dependent results. Therefore, a solid foundation of the technological properties of ultrasound would give health care providers a competitive advantage in the future. This is one of the first goals of this textbook. This textbook also covers general aspects of diagnostic ultrasound providing an excellent reference for both beginners and professionals. In addition, this textbook has end-of-the-chapter experiments that will help educators conduct labs for students and any other learners to enhance their learning and solidify the practical skills.",

They learn to interpret results and correlate with other laboratory data to identify disease.  Access to quality atlases are a vital tool in the students’ learning process. Because the cost of printing pictures is so great, the price of printed atlases is high. The number of images included is limited. And many excellent atlases are now out of print.This project seeks to eliminate those challenges for students by giving access to an Open Educational Resource (OER) atlas for urinalysis. This format is easily accessed during students’ time on campus and will continue into their careers as medical laboratory scientists. There are currently not many medical subject resources available as open resources. It is our hope that other healthcare professionals will find these resources beneficial. This project is unique in that students are the main contributors of the pictures used. While not entirely comprehensive at this point, the OER platform will allow for continual updating as new images and information become available.",

        "description": "Welcome toExploring the U.S. Healthcare System. This open educational resource (OER) introduces students to foundational characteristics of the U.S. healthcare system. It begins with an overview of the healthcare system that includes a brief history and a description of the current state of health in the U.S. The second chapter describes health delivery systems, including inpatient, outpatient, post-acute, longterm, palliative, and hospice care. An introduction to health insurance in the third chapter will include an overview of basic concepts, private insurance, public insurance, and recent trends. The fourth chapter presents issues related to the triple aim of improving access to care, increasing the quality of care, and lowering the cost of care. The fifth chapter reviews how the government intervenes in healthcare and presents current policy issues related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and value-based contracting. The final chapter on the topic of technology in healthcare provides an overview of health information technology, health information legislation, emerging technologies, and the future of health information technology. Chapter content is supplemented with additional material such as reports, briefs, figures, infographics, definitions, and key terms. Chapters two through six end with a “knowledge check” exercise to actively engage students with the content. While this OER book was curated and created for undergraduate students in the field of healthcare, it is my hope that it will continue to be customized to other programs and shared again.",

        "description": "Our world is the only planet, as far as we know, which harbors life. The number of humans on our planet has grown tremendously in recent centuries. In 1800 one billion humans occupied our earth; on 15 November 2022, this number reached 8 billion.A result of this growth, the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the primary greenhouse gas emitted by human activities, drastically increased. The increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere foster the long-term increase of our earth’s temperatures, also referred to as global warming.While the earth’s population grew, so did our mass consumption society. After the Second World War humanity witnessed gigantic global economic development with great technological improvements. Computers, laptops, airplanes, tablets and Internet of Things connected humans all over the world. The hunger for plastics and steel grew as all products had to be manufactured in ever-increasing volumes. As the economy developed, our consumption grew apace.The healthcare sector has seen the same increase of consumption. The number of patients grew, and so did the number of single-use medical products. As products become more complex and more different materials were combined., recycling became more difficult. Thus, hospitals transformed into waste factories with ever-growing waste streams. The consumption of (disposable) medical devices takes up scarce raw materials and contributes to the growing CO2 emissions.In this book, Van Straten, Alvino and Horeman present their findings on how to create a sustainable healthcare economy by introducing different circular strategies. In 9 chapters, they present a wide variation of studies as practical cases to show what strategies and actions can be taken in order to implement sustainable strategies for a circular healthcare.This book was written in line with the courses the authors developed at TU Extension School, the open online education edX platform of Delft University of Technology/TU Delft, a leading university in science and technology, recognized for its world-class research. This book is a manual for everyone who follows the online course ‘Circular strategies for a sustainable healthcare’, but certainly also for everyone who wants to discover more about circular strategies and wants to understand the principles and practices of circular economy and urban mining. This book is suitable for students, researchers, policymakers and practitioners in the fields of healthcare sustainability, management, business and economics.",

        "description": "Nursing Care at the End of Life: What Every Clinician Should Knowshould be an essential component of basic educational preparation for the professional registered nurse student. Recent studies show that only one in four nurses feel confident in caring for dying patients and their families and less than 2% of overall content in nursing textbooks is related to end-of-life care, despite the tremendous growth in palliative and end-of-life care programs across the country. The purpose of this textbook is to provide an indepth look at death and dying in this country, including the vital role of the nurse in assisting patients and families along the journey towards the end of life. There is an emphasis throughout the book on the simple, yet understated value of effective interpersonal communication between the patient and clinician. The text provides a basic foundation of understanding death and dying, including a brief historical examination of some main conceptual models associated with how patients cope with impending loss. An overview of illness trajectories and models of care, such as hospice and palliative care are discussed. Lastly, the latest evidence-based approaches for pain and symptom management, ethical concerns, cultural considerations, care at the time of death, and grief/bereavement are examined. The goal of this text is to foster the necessary skills for nurses to provide compassionate care to individuals who are nearing the end of life and their families. Every chapter contains a “What You Should Know” section which highlights and reinforces foundational concepts.",

Case studies have been popular in nursing to help students bring their learning to life and enhance their critical thinking. However, often case studies appear in one unit or one particular content area to aid students learning for a particular condition or point in time.Taking a transformational, place-based approach, the OER case studies for health are set within metropolitan and regional areas, so learning is contextual and relatable. Case studies increase in complexity so that students can be introduced to and ‘get to know’ the families from their first year of study. As students progress through their studies, they meet the families again in different, often more complex scenarios. The families experience a variety of political and socio-economic circumstances, which helps students to learn about various healthcare contexts, build knowledge and understanding about the families’ circumstances from a holistic, person-centred, interprofessional perspective, and engage at a deeper level.",

Inicia descifrando los cambios dietéticos de los primeros homínidos y cómo estos cambios influenciaron su desarrollo físico y cognitivo, desde la dentición hasta el aumento del tamaño cerebral. Luego analiza la influencia cultural y sociopolítica en la dieta de antiguas civilizaciones como Egipto, Roma y China. Se destaca la alimentación en culturas precolombinas, resaltando la diversidad agrícola, sus prácticas sostenibles y la conexión cósmica con la tierra. Aborda también, la Revolución Industrial y cómo transformó los patrones alimentarios, llevando a problemas de salud en la modernidad. También se discute la 'revolución verde' y las tecnologías para mejorar la producción alimentaria. Y finalmente se explica sobre la sostenibilidad en los sistemas alimentarios y las innovaciones para el futuro, como la carne de laboratorio y la nutrición basada en insectos. El libro concluye reconociendo la nutrición como una ciencia multidisciplinaria, que busca garantizar la salud y calidad de vida. Esta obra es el resultado de un esfuerzo colectivo de académicos que buscan entender la alimentación humana desde sus orígenes hasta el presente.",

        "description": "Epidemiologyis an openly licensed text designed for medical degree–seeking clinical students without a prior background in public health. Using sports medicine and injury prevention examples and applications, it aims to provide students with the basics of epidemiology terms and concepts and is intended to guide medical school students as they prepare for the USMLE Step 1 Exam and to transition from student to clinician. It includes an introduction to general concepts and terminology of epidemiology, study designs and their relationship to clinical questions, and the use of epidemiology in clinical diagnosis and screening of disease. Concluding sections of the book present sources of errors in epidemiologic studies, including bias, confounding, and effect modification. The book is notable for its use of accessible, inclusive figures and examples, and end-of-chapter study guides that summarize the chapter visually.Are you reviewing or adopting this book for a course?

        "description": "Most books about epidemiology are written for graduate students but this book is especially designed for undergraduates, who are taking an introductory course in epidemiology, and especially for those students who want to know more about epidemiology. But not because it is directed mainly to undergraduates and not to graduate students the course has less rigour and quality, it is because the concepts are introduced, and presented in an easier and simplified form, so, the study of epidemiology becomes less intimidating. While teaching epidemiology for several years, I have found that some students don’t choose epidemiology as a career because the content seems too complicated, presenting the content in a practical manner, and simpler (although some epidemiological concepts are very complex); should motivate students to learn about this subject matter.",

        "description": "Dental implants have been an established treatment option for partially and completely edentulous patients for decades. In the first years of their clinical use, the theoretical background on osseointegration and implant prosthodontics was covered by textbooks that have been characterized as “classical”, and any further research results were reported in scientific papers. During the years, the continuing introduction of new prosthetic components and treatment options has led to evolution in Implant Prosthodontics. Clinicians are informed on these innovations from research papers but each of them is focused on a specific topic or technique. The purpose of this book is to offer a thorough introduction to current Implant Prosthodontics, combining theory and practice in an easy-to-read manner. In each chapter the needed theoretical background and principles are reported, and the techniques are presented with clinical examples in step-by-step manner. The aim is to guide the dentist in his practice combining the needed knowledge with the clinical application and relevance. For this reason, it can be characterized as “A case-based Clinical Guide”. On the other side, clinicians are always concerned about the stages or steps in each technique and for this reason, emphasis has been given to the detailed description of each case with critical discussion on the selection of each specific treatment option. The content of this book is divided in 9 chapters that cover the whole clinical procedure for an implant restoration, from the presurgical evaluation to the fabrication and delivery. The chapters include the needed diagnostic elements for the treatment planning, the design and fabrication of radiographic and surgical guides, the impression techniques, the use of intra-oral scanning, an overview of cement- and screw retained restorations, the digital workflow in implant restorations and the principles for selection and fabrication of implant overdentures.",

Qualitative research designs are diverse and each design has a different focus that will inform the approach undertaken and the results that are generated. The aim is to move beyond the “what” of qualitative research to the “how”, by (1) outlining key qualitative research designs for health and social care research – descriptive, phenomenology, action research, case study, ethnography, and grounded theory; (2) a decision tool of how to select the appropriate design based on a guiding prompting question, the research question and available resources, time and expertise; (3) an overview of mixed methods research and qualitative research in evaluation studies; (4) a practical guide to data collection and analysis; (5) providing examples of qualitative research to illustrate the scope and opportunities; and (6) tips on communicating qualitative research.",
