        "description": "'The information technology revolution is transforming almost every aspect of society, but girls and women are largely out of the loop. Although women surf the Web in equal numbers to men and make the majority of online purchases, few are involved in the design and creation of new technology. It is mostly men whose perspectives and priorities inform the development of computing innovations and who reap the lion's share of the financial rewards. As only a small fraction of high school and college computer science students are female, the field is likely to remain a 'male clubhouse,' absent major changes.'. 'In Unlocking the Clubhouse, social scientist Jane Margolis and computer scientist and educator Allan Fisher examine the many influences contributing to the gender gap in computing. The book is based on interviews with more than 100 computer science students of both sexes from Carnegie Mellon University, a major center of computer science research, over a period of four years, as well as classroom observations and conversations with hundreds of college and high school faculty.'--BOOK JACKET.",

        "description": "This work provides a short 'getting started' guide to Fortran 90/95. The main target audience consists of newcomers to the field of numerical computation within Earth system sciences (students, researchers or scientific programmers). Furthermore, readers accustomed to other programming languages may also benefit from this work, by discovering how some programming techniques they are familiar with map to Fortran 95. The main goal is to enable readers to quickly start using Fortran 95 for writing useful programs. It also introduces a gradual discussion of Input/Output facilities relevant for Earth system sciences, from the simplest ones to the more advanced netCDF library (which has become a de facto standard for handling the massive datasets used within Earth system sciences). While related works already treat these disciplines separately (each often providing much more information than needed by the beginning practitioner), the reader finds in this book a shorter guide which links them. Compared to other books, this work provides a much more compact view of the language, while also placing the language-elements in a more applied setting, by providing examples related to numerical computing and more advanced Input/Output facilities for Earth system sciences. Naturally, the coverage of the programming language is relatively shallow, since many details are skipped. However, many of these details can be learned gradually by the practitioner, after getting an overview and some practice with the language through this book.",

        "description": "The correct development of large software systems demands a thorough structuring of the design process. In a first phase the requirements engineering is relevant for capturing the relevant functionality and its adequate and precise mathematical formalization. Prototyping can be used as a means for checking the functional behaviour at this early stage of development. The specification resulting from the first phase is then the basis for the second phase which comprises the derivation of an efficient implementation. This phase requires the use of formal methods and tools to verify/validate the implementation. Of course, a prerequisite for applying this approach to large systems is to have suitable tool support. This book presents tools that aim at the formal and computer-aided development of software. Furthermore, it discusses the theories and methods underlying the tools, applications, and limits. Finally, it describes many case studies. The presented tools and methods vary from academic to industrial, from fully automatic to interactive, and from animation and prototyping to formula manipulation, theorem proving, i.e., formal verification. Thus, the reader gets an overview of the wide-ranging applicability of formal methods and the computer-aided software development.",

In the long run, this task will ensure the development of a functional theory of language, an objective method of verification, and a wide range of practical applications. Natural communication requires not only verbal processing, but also non-verbal perception and action. Therefore, the content of this textbook is organized as a theory of language for the construction of talking robots. The main topic is the mechanics of natural language communication in both, the hearer and the speaker. The contents is divided into four parts: Theory of Language, Formal Grammar, Morphology and Syntax, Semantics and Pragmatics. The book contains more than 700 exercises for reviewing key ideas and important problems.",

        "description": "SMS or Text is one of the most popular forms of messaging. Yet, despite its immense popularity, SMS has remained unexamined by science. Not only that, but the commercial organisations, who have been forced to offer SMS by a demanding public, have had very little idea why it has been successful. Indeed, they have, until very recently, planned to replace SMS with other messaging services such as MMS. This book is the first to bring together scientific studies into the values that ‘texting’ provides, examining both cultural variation in countries as different as the Philippines and Germany, as well as the differences between SMS and other communications channels like Instant Messaging and the traditional letter. It presents usability and design research which explores how SMS will evolve and what is likely to be the pattern of person-to-person messaging in the future. In short, The Inside Text is a fundamental resource for anyone interested in mobile communications at the start of the 21st Century.",

        "description": "The last decade has witnessed a rapid surge of interest in new sensing and monitoring devices for healthcare. One key development in this area is wireless wearable and implantable in vivo monitoring and intervention devices. While the problems of long-term stability and biocompatibility are being addressed, several promising prototypes are starting to emerge for managing patients with acute diabetes, for treatment of epilepsy and other debilitating neurological disorders and for monitoring of patients with chronic cardiac diseases. Despite the technological developments in sensing and monitoring devices, issues related to system integration, sensor miniaturization, low-power sensor interface circuitry design, wireless telemetric links and signal processing still have to be investigated. This book addresses the general issues related to the rapidly changing field of Body Sensor Networks (BSN) and discusses the latest technological developments and potential clinical applications. Key contents of the book include: Biosensor Design, Interfacing and Protein Engineering Wireless Communication and Network Topologies Communication Protocols and Standards Energy Scavenging Ultra-Low Power Bio-inspired Processing Multi-sensor Fusion and Context-aware Sensing Autonomic Sensing System Integration and Wireless sensor Microsystem Design The book also provides a comprehensive review of current wireless sensor development platforms and a step-by-step guide to developing your own BSN applications through the use of the BSN Development Kit. Online materials and the latest updates for the BSN Development Kit are available fromhttp://www.bsn-web.info.",

This monograph brings out recent advances in the research in the area of visualization of hyperspectral data. It provides a set of pixel-based fusion techniques, each of which is based on a different framework and has its own advantages and disadvantages. The techniques are presented with complete details so that practitioners can easily implement them. It is also demonstrated how one can select only a few specific bands to speed up the process of fusion by exploiting spatial correlation within successive bands of the hyperspectral data. While the techniques for fusion of hyperspectral images are being developed, it is also important to establish a framework for objective assessment of such techniques. This monograph has a dedicated chapter describing various fusion performance measures that are applicable to hyperspectral image fusion. This monograph also presents a notion of consistency of a fusion technique which can be used to verify the suitability and applicability of a technique for fusion of a very large number of images. This book will be a highly useful resource to the students, researchers, academicians and practitioners in the specific area of hyperspectral image fusion, as well as generic image fusion.",

        "description": "Complex systems in nature and society make use of information for the development of their internal organization and the control of their functional mechanisms. Alongside technical aspects of storing, transmitting and processing information, the various semantic aspects of information, such as meaning, sense, reference and function, play a decisive part in the analysis of such systems.With the aim of fostering a better understanding of semantic systems from an evolutionary and multidisciplinary perspective, this volume collects contributions by philosophers and natural scientists, linguists, information and computer scientists. They do not follow a single research paradigm; rather they shed, in a complementary way, new light upon some of the most important aspects of the evolution of semantic systems.Evolution of Semantic Systems is intended for researchers in philosophy, computer science, and the natural sciences who work on the analysis or development of semantic systems, ontologies, or similar complex information structures. In the eleven chapters, they will find a broad discussion of topics ranging from underlying universal principles to representation and processing aspects to paradigmatic examples.",

        "description": "Originally published in 1999,Wavelets Made Easyoffers a lucid and concise explanation of mathematical wavelets.  Written at the level of a first course in calculus and linear algebra, its accessible presentation is designed for undergraduates in a variety of disciplines—computer science, engineering, mathematics, mathematical sciences—as well as for practicing professionals in these areas.  The present softcover reprint retains the corrections from the second printing (2001) and makes this unique text available to a wider audience. The first chapter starts with a description of the key features and applications of wavelets, focusing on Haar's wavelets but using only high-school mathematics. The next two chapters introduce one-, two-, and three-dimensional wavelets, with only the occasional use of matrix algebra.  The second part of this book provides the foundations of least-squares approximation, the discrete Fourier transform, and Fourier series. The third part explains the Fourier transform and then demonstrates how to apply basic Fourier analysis to designing and analyzing mathematical wavelets. Particular attention is paid to Daubechies wavelets.  Numerous exercises, a bibliography, and a comprehensive index combine to make this book an excellent text for the classroom as well as a valuable resource for self-study.       ",

        "description": "Ontologies have been developed and investigated for some time in artificial intelligence to facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse. More recently, the notion of ontologies has attracted attention from fields such as databases, intelligent information integration, cooperative information systems, information retrieval, electronic commerce, enterprise application integration, and knowledge management. This broadened interest in ontologies is based on the feature that they provide a machine-processable semantics of information sources that can be communicated among agents as well as between software artifacts and humans. This feature makes ontologies the backbone technology of the next web generation, i.e., the Semantic Web. Ontologies are currently applied in areas such as knowledge management in large company-wide networks and call centers, and in B2C, B2G, and B2B electronic commerce. In a nutshell, ontologies enable effective and efficient access to heterogeneous and distributed information sources. Given the increasing amount of information available online, this kind of support is becoming more important day by day. The author systematically introduces the notion of ontologies to the non-expert reader and demonstrates in detail how to apply this conceptual framework for improved intranet retrieval of corporate information and knowledge and for enhanced Internet-based electronic commerce. He also describes ontology languages (XML, RDF, and OWL) and ontology tools, and the application of ontologies. In addition to structural improvements, the second edition covers recent developments relating to the Semantic Web, and emerging web-based standard languages.",

Domain decomposition methods are iterative methods for solving the often very large linearor nonlinear systems of algebraic equations that arise when various problems in continuum mechanics are discretized using finite elements. They are designed for massively parallel computers and take the memory hierarchy of such systems in mind. This is essential for approaching peak floating point performance. There is an increasingly well developed theory whichis having a direct impact on the development and improvements of these algorithms.",

The fragmentation of research agendas and proposed approaches or solutions for securing the future smart grid becomes apparent observing the results from different projects, standards, committees, etc, in different countries. The different approaches and views of the papers in this collection also witness this fragmentation. This book contains three full-paper length invited papers and 7 corrected and extended papers from the First International Workshop on Smart Grid Security, SmartGridSec 2012, which brought together researchers from different communities from academia and industry in the area of securing the Future Smart Grid and was held in Berlin, Germany, on December 3, 2012.",

        "description": "With their intuitive graphical approach and expressive analysis techniques, Petri nets are suitable for a wide range of applications and teaching scenarios, and they have gained wide acceptance as a modeling technique in areas such as software design and control engineering. The core theoretical principles have been studied for many decades and there is now a comprehensive research literature that complements the extensive implementation experience. In this book the author presents a clear, thorough introduction to the essentials of Petri nets. He explains the core modeling techniques and analysis methods and he illustrates their usefulness with examples and case studies. Part I describes how to use Petri nets for modeling; all concepts are explained with the help of examples, starting with a generic, powerful model which is also intuitive and realistic.^ Part II covers the essential analysis methods that are specific to Petri nets, introducing techniques used to formulate key properties of system nets and algorithms for proving their validity. Part III presents case studies, each introducing new concepts, properties and analysis techniques required for very different modeling tasks. The author offers different paths among the chapters and sections: the elementary strand for readers who wish to study only elementary nets; the modeling strand for those who wish to study the modeling but not the analysis of systems; and finally the elementary models of the modeling strand for those interested in technically simple, but challenging examples and case studies. The author achieves an excellent balance between consistency, comprehensibility and correctness in a book of distinctive design.^ Among its characteristics, formal arguments are reduced to a minimum in the main text with many of the theoretical formalisms moved to an appendix, the explanations are supported throughout with fully integrated graphical illustrations, and each chapter ends with exercises and recommendations for further reading. The book is suitable for students of computer science and related subjects such as engineering, and for a broad range of researchers and practitioners.",

These involve complex systems, in which multiple simple agents, be they vehicles or particles, give rise to surprising and fascinating phenomena. The contributions collected in these proceedings cover several research fields, all of which deal with transport. Topics include highway, pedestrian and internet traffic; granular matter; biological transport; transport networks; data acquisition; data analysis and technological applications. Different perspectives, i.e., modeling, simulations, experiments, and phenomenological observations are considered.",

This book provides a survey on line and hyperplane location combining analytical and geometrical methods. The major portion of the text presents new results on this topic, including the extension of some special cases to all distances derived from norms and a discussion of restricted problems in the plane. Almost all results are proven in the text and most of them are illustrated by examples. Furthermore, relations to classical facility location and to problems in computational geometry are pointed out. Audience: The book is suitable for researchers, lecturers, and graduate students working in the fields of location theory or computational geometry.",

But unlike in previous times, 3D technology has now rapidly entered our daily life from cinema to office to home. Using 3D for education is a new yet challenging task. This book will present several innovative efforts using 3D for immersive and interactive learning covering a wide spectrum of education including gifted program, normal (technical) stream, and special needs education. The book will also share experience on curriculum-based 3D learning in classroom setting and co-curriculum-based 3D student research projects. The book is organized as follows. Chapter 1 introduces the fundamentals of 3D educational technology and their applications in immersive and interactive learning. Chapter 2 discusses the use of virtual reality in teaching and learning of Molecular Biology. Chapter 3 presents the daVinci Lab @ River Valley High School. Chapter 4 describes the 3D education development process. Chapter 5 studies the adaption 3D system for learning gains in lower secondary normal (technical) stream. Chapter 6 investigates the effects of virtual reality technology on spatial visualization skills. Chapter 7 showcases a sabbatical program for students to use 3D for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning. Chapter 8 shares the use of 3D virtual pink dolphin to assist special education. The foreword of this book is written by Dr Cheah Horn Mun, Director, Education Technology Division, Ministry of Education, Singapore.",

In order to unify and generalize the results obtained so far, new concepts have been introduced, e.g., an infinite order chain representation of the continued fraction expansion of irrationals, the conditional measures associated with, and the extended random variables corresponding to that representation. Also, such procedures as singularization and insertion allow to obtain most of the continued fraction expansions related to the regular continued fraction expansion. The authors present and prove with full details for the first time in book form, the most recent developments in solving the celebrated 1812 Gauss' problem which originated the metrical theory of continued fractions. At the same time, they study exhaustively the Perron-Frobenius operator, which is of basic importance in this theory, on various Banach spaces including that of functions of bounded variation on the unit interval. The book is of interest to research workers and advanced Ph.D. students in probability theory, stochastic processes and number theory.",

        "description": "Softwaretests bekommen bei immer komplexer werdenden Programmen eine immer größere Bedeutung für den Projekterfolg. Obwohl Testkonzepte etabliert sind, werden sie häufig nur in geringem Maße in Unternehmen genutzt, da sie angeblich zu aufwändig und zu teuer sind. Neben einer intuitiven Einführung in Testtechniken zeigt dieses Buch den schnellen Einstieg in das Testen von Java-Programmen mit Hilfe von einfach nutzbaren Open-Source-Werkzeugen. Dabei werden neben klassischen Programmen auch Vorgehensweisen und Werkzeuge für Systeme mit Datenbankintegration und Web-Applikationen betrachtet, die nicht nur für Java-Programme nutzbar sind. Die Werkzeuge decken dabei funktionale Tests, Testüberdeckungen, Tests von Oberflächen, Performance- und Lasttests, sowie die Automatisierung von Testausführungen ab. Alle Beispiele stehen als Download zur Verfügung. Der Inhalt: Überblick über die Qualitätssicherung - Unit-Tests - Überdeckungsmaße - Mocking - Test von Nutzungsoberflächen - Applikationen mit Datenbankanbindung - Test von Web-Applikationen - Performance- und Lasttests - Testautomatisierung Die Zielgruppe: - Informatik-Studierende ab 4. Semester - Studierende in Informatik-orientierten Master-Studiengängen - Entwickler kritischer Software-Systeme - IT-Projektmanager Der Autor: Prof. Dr. Stephan Kleuker unterrichtet seit mehreren Jahren Software-Engineering und Software-Qualität an der Hochschule Osnabrück. Sein Forschungsschwerpunkt liegt in der Steigerung der Qualität Java-basierter Software. Er ist Autor mehrerer Fachbücher und hat mehrjährige Praxiserfahrung als Systemanalytiker sowie als Berater bei der Erstellung komplexer Software-Systeme.",

        "description": "Ein kompakter und praxisorientierter Einstieg, mit dem Studierende bereits früh im Studium sehr gut zurechtkommen. Die verschiedenen Phasen einer Datenbankentwicklung werden mit ihren Vorgehensweisen, Konzepten und möglichen Problemquellen vorgestellt. Gerade die Anforderungsanalyse und die Möglichkeit zur Erstellung mächtiger SQL-Anfragen werden als besonders praxisrelevante Aspekte betont. Studierende sind nach der Lektüre in der Lage, in Praxisprojekten erfolgreich mitzuarbeiten und das Buch deckt eine Einführungsvorlesung vollständig ab. In der dritten Auflage wurden automatisierbare Testmöglichkeiten ergänzt. Neben vielen kleinen Beispielen zur Verdeutlichung einzelner Aspekte wird ein durchgehendes Beispiel genutzt. Alle Kapitel schließen mit Wiederholungsfragen und Übungsaufgaben, deren Lösungen online zum Download zur Verfügung stehen. Inhalt Datenbankgrundlagen - Ermittlung der Anforderungen an Datenbanken - Datenmodellierung - Tabellendefinition in SQL - Einfache Anfragen in SQL - Verschachtelte Anfragen in SQL - Transaktionen - Stored Procedures und Trigger - JDBC - Test von Datenbanken Zielgruppe Informatikstudierende an Fachhochschulen und Universitäten Studierende mit Nebenfach Informatik an Fachhochschulen und Universitäten Informatikstudierende an Berufsakademien IT-Praktiker mit Fortbildungsinteresse Autor Prof. Dr. Stephan Kleuker unterrichtet seit mehreren Jahren Software-Engineering, Datenbanken und Software-Qualität an der Hochschule Osnabrück.

        "description": "President Barack Obama, in his 2011 State of the Union Address, called America 'the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers' and 'of Google and Facebook.' U.S. Chief Information Officer, Steven VanRoekel, said that America has become a 'Facebook nation' that demands increased transparency and interactivity from the federal government. Facebook as a nation in 2012 would be the third largest country in the world with over 900 million citizens, after China and India. This book portrays the social media ecosystem as a world of increasing Total Information Awareness, which is essentially a civilian version of the controversial Total Information Awareness program unveiled in 2002 by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) at the U.S. Department of Defense. Back in the 60's, DARPA initiated and funded the research and development of Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) that went online in 1969. The success of ARPANET gave rise to the global commercial Internet in the 90's and the new generation of Fortune 500 companies today including Amazon.com, Google, eBay, and Yahoo!. As if life comes full circle in the 21st century, private businesses and the ubiquity of social networks such as Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and YouTube are creating the technologies and infrastructures necessary for the DARPA-proposed Total Information Awareness program.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange called Facebook 'the most appalling spying machine that has ever been invented.' Indeed, military and civilian technologies have interwoven into every fabric of our society, as Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, 'We exist at the intersection of technology and social issues.' This book offers discourse and practical advice on the privacy issue in the age of big data, the rise of Facebook nation, and Total Information Awareness. Opening with President Ronald Reagan's 1984 National Security Decision Directive and ending with George Orwell's novel 1984, the author takes us on a roller-coaster ride through Facebook's botched IPO, Carrier IQ, Kony 2012, SOPA/PIPA blackout, cyber bullying, crime fighting, and a host of other timely issues facing our Facebook nation. Social media strategists, information architects, social scientists, policymakers, and academic scholars in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) will find this book a valuable asset.",

Features based on speaking rate characteristics are explored with the help of multi-stage and hybrid models for further improving emotion recognition performance. Proposed spectral and prosodic features are evaluated on real life emotional speech corpus.",

Personas, a user centered design methodology covers topics from interaction design within IT, through to issues surrounding product design, communication, and marketing.Project developers need to understand how users approach their products from the product’s infancy, and regardless of what the product might be. Developers should be able to describe the user of the product via vivid depictions, as if they – with their different attitudes, desires and habits – were already using the product. In doing so they can more clearly formulate how to turn the product's potential into reality.With contributions from professionals from Australia, Brazil, Finland, Japan, Russia, and the UK presenting real-world examples of persona method, this book will provide readers with valuable insights into this exciting research area. The inspiration to create user descriptions includes character-driven narratives, and the film Thelma & Louise is analyzed in order to understand how the development process can also be an engaging story in various professional contexts.With a solid foundation in her own research at the IT University of Copenhagen and more than five years of experience in solving problems for businesses, Lene Nielsen is Denmark’s leading expert in the persona method. She has a PhD in personas and scenarios, and through her research and practical experiences she has developed her own approach to the method – 10 Steps to Personas. Personas – User Focused Design presents a step-by-step methodology of personas which will be of interest to developers of IT, communications solutions and innovative products.",

Spatially structured EAs have different properties than standard, mixing EAs. By virtue of the structured disposition of the population members they bring about new dynamical features that can be harnessed to solve difficult problems faster and more efficiently. This book describes the state of the art in spatially structured EAs by using graph concepts as a unifying theme. The models, their analysis, and their empirical behavior are presented in detail. Moreover, there is new material on non-standard networked population structures such as small-world networks. The book should be of interest to advanced undergraduate and graduate students working in evolutionary computation, machine learning, and optimization. It should also be useful to researchers and professionals working in fields where the topological structures of populations and their evolution plays a role.",

It is crucial that developers understand this area because the numerical operations allowed by computers, and the limitations of those operations, especially in the area of floating point math, affect virtually everything people try to do with computers. This book aims to fill this gap by exploring, in sufficient but not overwhelming detail, just what it is that computers do with numbers. Divided into two parts, the first deals with standard representations of integers and floating point numbers, while the second details several other number representations. Each chapter ends with exercises to review the key points. Topics covered include interval arithmetic, fixed-point numbers, floating point numbers, big integers and rational arithmetic. This book is for anyone who develops software including software engineerings, scientists, computer science students, engineering students and anyone who programs for fun.' -- Publisher's website",

        "description": "This book focuses on the nonlinear behaviour of thin-wall shells (single- and multilayered with delamination areas) under various uniform and non-uniform loadings. The dependence of critical (buckling) load upon load variability is revealed to be highly non-monotonous, showing minima when load variability is close to the eigenmode variabilities of solution branching points of the respective nonlinear boundary problem.A novel numerical approach is employed to analyze branching points and to build primary, secondary, and tertiary bifurcation paths of the nonlinear boundary problem for the case of uniform loading. The load levels of singular points belonging to the paths are considered to be critical load estimates for the case of non-uniform loadings.",

The book uses an active learning and problem-solving approach to present key topics in computer science, along with real-world examples and practical algorithms. The author explains how to read, rather than write, programs and how to solve problems. To provide a good understanding of computing without covering everything in the field, short focused chapters include tutorial projects and interactive labs that use Ruby, a simple open-source language.'-- 'The title of this book, Explorations in Computing, conveys the idea of how we will use a similar active learning approach to study computation. Each chapter is organized around a single project that introduces an important concept or application in computer science. To complete the project, students type commands in Ruby, an interactive programming language,following a detailed script set out in the text. The aim is for the students to immerse themselves in the interactive environment, and experience first-hand what goes on inside a computer as it solves some interesting problems. Many parts of the projects are open-ended, and students are encouraged to continue exploring on their own, after using the exercises in the book as a starting point'--",

Argumentation theory studies reasoning and argument, and especially those aspects not addressed, or not addressed well, by formal deduction. The philosophy of mathematical practice diverges from mainstream philosophy of mathematics in the emphasis it places on what the majority of working mathematicians actually do, rather than on mathematical foundations. The book begins by first challenging the assumption that there is no role for informal logic in mathematics. Next, it details the usefulness of argumentation theory in the understanding of mathematical practice, offering an impressively diverse set of examples, covering the history of mathematics, mathematics education and, perhaps surprisingly, formal proof verification. From there, the book demonstrates that mathematics also offers a valuable testbed for argumentation theory. Coverage concludes by defending attention to mathematical argumentation as the basis for new perspectives on the philosophy of mathematics.",

The objective is, in particular, to provide guidelines for performing experiments evaluating methods, techniques and tools in software engineering. The introduction is provided through a process perspective. The focus is on the steps that must be taken to perform experiments and quasi-experiments. The process also includes other types of empirical studies.' 'Experimentation in Software Engineering: An Introduction is suitable for use as a textbook or a secondary text for graduate courses, and for researchers and practitioners interested in an empirical approach to software engineering.'--BOOK JACKET.",

The theory of nonlinear complex systems has become a successful problem-solving approach in the natural sciences from laser physics, quantum chaos, and meteorology to computer simulations of cell growth in biology. It is now recognized that many of our social, economic, ecological, and political problems are also of a global, complex, and nonlinear nature. And one of the most exciting contemporary topics is the idea that even the human mind is governed largely by the nonlinear dynamics of complex systems. Professor Mainzer, president of the German Society of Complex Systems and Nonlinear Dynamics, discusses, in a nontechnical language, the common framework behind these endeavors. The extended edition also analyzes the new applications of complex systems to materials science, nanotechnology, and artificial life.",

With so many new groups and projects, it can be difficult to identify the best ones. This book summarizes ten leading projects from around the world. About 60 submissions were received in 2011 for the highly competitive BCI Research Award, and an international jury selected the top ten. This Brief gives a concise but carefully illustrated and fully up-to-date description of each of these projects, together with an introduction and concluding chapter by the editors.--",

        "description": "How do we design a self-organizing system? Is it possible to validate and control non-deterministic dynamics? What is the right balance between the emergent patterns that bring robustness, adaptability and scalability, and the traditional need for verification and validation of the outcomes? The last several decades have seen much progress from original ideas of “emergent functionality” and “design for emergence”, to sophisticated mathematical formalisms of “guided self-organization”. And yet the main challenge remains, attracting the best scientific and engineering expertise to this elusive problem. This book presents state-of-the-practice of successfully engineered self-organizing systems, and examines ways to balance design and self-organization in the context of applications. As demonstrated in this second edition of Advances in Applied Self-Organizing Systems, finding this balance helps to deal with practical challenges as diverse as navigation of microscopic robots within blood vessels, self-monitoring aerospace vehicles, collective and modular robotics adapted for autonomous reconnaissance and surveillance, self-managing grids and multiprocessor scheduling, data visualization and self-modifying digital and analog circuitry, intrusion detection in computer networks, reconstruction of hydro-physical fields, traffic management, immunocomputing and nature-inspired computation. Many algorithms proposed and discussed in this volume are biologically inspired, and the reader will also gain an insight into cellular automata, genetic algorithms, artificial immune systems, snake-like locomotion, ant foraging, birds flocking, neuromorphic circuits, amongst others. Demonstrating the practical relevance and applicability of self-organization, Advances in Applied Self-Organizing Systems will be an invaluable tool for advanced students and researchers in a wide range of fields.",

        "description": "Cryptology, for millennia a 'secret science', is rapidly gaining in practical importance for the protection of communication channels, databases, and software. Beside its role in computerized information systems (public key systems), more and more applications within computer systems and networks are appearing, which also extend to access rights and source file protection. The first part of this book treats secret codes and their uses - cryptography. The second part deals with the process of covertly decrypting a secret code - cryptanalysis - where in particular advice on assessing methods is given. The book presupposes only elementary mathematical knowledge. Spiced with a wealth of exciting, amusing, and sometimes personal stories from the history of cryptology, it will also interest general readers. Decrypted Secrets has become a standard book on cryptology. The new edition has been revised and extended in many details, particularly on the ENIGMA and other rotor machines, on cipher teletype machines, codenamed FISH by the British, and on key negotiation. 'The best single book on cryptology today' (David Kahn, Cryptologia) 'For those who work actively with cryptology this book is a must. For amateurs it is an important dictionary which in many cases will guide them to make their ciphers more secure.' (Arne Fransén, International Intelligence History Study Group)",

        "description": "This book describes two ISO standardization projects - the Computer Graphics Interface (CGI) and the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM). It has been written principally for users and practitioners of computer graphics. In particular, system designers, independent software vendors, graphics system implementors, and application program developers need to understand the basic standards being put into place at the so-called Virtual Device Interface. Technical managers, graduate students in computer science specializing in graphics, and buyers in government and industry will also find this book valuable. The CGI project is standardizing a functional and syntactic specification for the exchange of device-independent data and associated control information between systems with graphical capabilities. The CGI defines idealized abstract classes of graphical devices capable of accepting input and generating, storing and manipulating pictures. The CGM provides a file format suitable for the storage and retrieval of device-independent picture descriptions. Pictures described by a sequence of CGI function invocations can be written to disk and stored compactly as CGMs, and CGMs can be interpreted and displayed efficiently using a CGI implementation. Formal standards documents are difficult to read. They are dry, complex and lack tutorial material. This book is intended to supplement the standards documents themselves. Organized into four parts comprising seventeen chapters, it includes many illustrations and examples not found in the standards. The book also explains the relationship of the CGI and CGM to other standards, both formal and de facto, describes some early commercial implementations of the standards, and gives the reader insight into the future evolution of these standards.",

It turns out that even for the simplest data processing algorithms, this problem is, in general, intractable. This book describes for what classes of problems interval computations (i.e. data processing with automatic results verification) are feasible, and when they are intractable. This knowledge is important, e.g. for algorithm developers, because it will enable them to concentrate on the classes of problems for which general algorithms are possible.",

This conference is a merger of the 7th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications (ICPCA) and the 4th Symposium on Web Society (SWS). The 53 revised full papers and 26 short papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from 143 submissions. The papers cover a wide range of topics from different research communities such as computer science, sociology and psychology and explore both theoretical and practical issues in and around the emerging computing paradigms, e.g., pervasive collaboration, collaborative business, and networked societies.

The traditional methods of 'abstract' graph theory are often incapable of providing satisfactory answers to questions arising in such applications. In the past couple of decades, many powerful new combinatorial and topological techniques have been developed to tackle these problems. Today geometric graph theory is a burgeoning field with many striking results and appealing open questions. This contributed volume contains thirty original survey and research papers on important recent developments in geometric graph theory.  The contributions were thoroughly reviewed and written by excellent researchers in this field.",

        "description": "This carefully edited volume presents a collection of recent works in fuzzy model identification. It opens the field of fuzzy identification to conventional control theorists as a complement to existing approaches, provides practicing control engineers with the algorithmic and practical aspects of a set of new identification techniques, and emphasizes opportunities for a more systematic and coherent theory of fuzzy identification by bringing together methods based on different techniques but aiming at the identification of the same types of fuzzy models. In control engineering, mathematical models are often constructed, for example based on differential or difference equations or derived from physical laws without using system data (white-box models) or using data but no insight (black-box models). In this volume the authors choose a combination of these models from types of structures that are known to be flexible and successful in applications. They consider Mamdani, Takagi-Sugeno, and singleton models, employing such identification methods as clustering, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and classical learning. All authors use the same notation and terminology, and each describes the model to be identified and the identification technique with algorithms that will help the reader to apply the presented methods in his or her own environment to solve real-world problems. Furthermore, each author gives a practical example to show how the presented method works, and deals with the issues of prior knowledge, model complexity, robustness of the identification method, and real-world applications.",

Dynamic Modeling introduces an approach to modeling that makes it a more practical, intuitive endeavor. The book enables readers to convert their understanding of a phenomenon to a computer model, and then to run the model and let it yield the inevitable dynamic consequences built into the structure of the model. Dynamic Modeling uses STELLA software to develop simulation models. Part I provides an introduction to modeling dynamic systems. Part II offers general methods for modeling. Parts III through VIII apply these methods to model real-world phenomena from chemistry, genetics, ecology, economics, and engineering. Dynamic Modeling offers a clear, approachable introduction to the modeling process, and will be of interest in any field where real problems can be illuminated by computer simulation.",

The security of these cryptosystems relies heavily on these three infeasible problems, as no polynomial-time algorithms exist for them so far. However, polynomial-time quantum algorithms for IFP, DLP and ECDLP do exist, provided that a practical quantum computer exists.Quantum Attacks on Public-Key Cryptosystems presemts almost all known quantum computing based attacks on public-key cryptosystems, with an emphasis on quantum algorithms for IFP, DLP, and ECDLP. It also discusses some quantum resistant cryptosystems to replace the IFP, DLP and ECDLP based cryptosystems.This book is intended to be used either as a graduate text in computing, communications and mathematics, or as a basic reference in the field.",

        "description": "Monte Carlo statistical methods, particularly those based on Markov chains, are now an essential component of the standard set of techniques used by statisticians. This new edition has been revised towards a coherent and flowing coverage of these simulation techniques, with incorporation of the most recent developments in the field. In particular, the introductory coverage of random variable generation has been totally revised, with many concepts being unified through a fundamental theorem of simulation. There are five completely new chapters that cover Monte Carlo control, reversible jump, slice sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, and perfect sampling. There is a more in-depth coverage of Gibbs sampling, which is now contained in three consecutive chapters. The development of Gibbs sampling starts with slice sampling and its connection with the fundamental theorem of simulation, and builds up to two-stage Gibbs sampling and its theoretical properties. A third chapter covers the multi-stage Gibbs sampler and its variety of applications. Lastly, chapters from the previous edition have been revised towards easier access, with the examples getting more detailed coverage. This textbook is intended for a second year graduate course, but will also be useful to someone who either wants to apply simulation techniques for the resolution of practical problems or wishes to grasp the fundamental principles behind those methods. The authors do not assume familiarity with Monte Carlo techniques (such as random variable generation), with computer programming, or with any Markov chain theory (the necessary concepts are developed in Chapter 6). A solutions manual, which covers approximately 40% of the problems, is available for instructors who require the book for a course.--back cover",

        "description": "In our modern information societies, we not only use and welcome computers; we are highly dependent upon them. There is a downside of this kind of progress, however. Computers are not 100% reliable. They are insecure. They are vulnerable to attackers. They can either be attacked directly, to disrupt their services, or they can be abused in clever ways to do the bidding of an attacker as a dysfunctional user.Decision-makers and experts alike always struggle with the amount of interdisciplinary knowledge needed to understand the nuts and bolts of modern information societies and their relation to security, the implications of technological or political progress or the lack thereof. This holds in particular for new challenges to come. These are harder to understand and to categorize; their development is difficult to predict. To mitigate this problem and to enable more foresight, The Secure Information Society provides an interdisciplinary spotlight onto some new and unfolding aspects of the uneasy relationship between information technology and information society, to aid the dialogue not only in its current and ongoing struggle, but to anticipate the future in time and prepare perspectives for the challenges ahead.",

The book examines U.S. counterterrorism history, technologies, and strategies from a unique and thought-provoking approach that encompasses personal experiences, investigative journalism, historical and current events, ideas from great thought leaders, and even the make-believe of Hollywood. Demystifying Total Information Awareness, the author expounds on the U.S. intelligence community, artificial intelligence in data mining, social media and privacy, cyber attacks and prevention, causes and cures for terrorism, and longstanding issues of war and peace. The book offers practical advice for businesses, governments, and individuals to better secure the world and protect cyberspace. It quotes U.S. Navy Admiral and NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis: “Instead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges.” The book also provides a glimpse into the future of Plan X and Generation Z, along with an ominous prediction from security advisor Marc Goodman at TEDGlobal 2012: “If you control the code, you control the world.” Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness will keep you up at night but at the same time give you some peace of mind knowing that “our problems are manmade — therefore they can be solved by man [or woman],” as President John F. Kennedy said at the American University commencement in June 1963.",

        "description": "The issue of data quality is as old as data itself. However, the proliferation of diverse, large-scale and often publically available data on the Web has increased the risk of poor data quality and misleading data interpretations. On the other hand, data is now exposed at a much more strategic level e.g. through business intelligence systems, increasing manifold the stakes involved for individuals, corporations as well as government agencies. There, the lack of knowledge about data accuracy, currency or completeness can have erroneous and even catastrophic results. With these changes, traditional approaches to data management in general, and data quality control specifically, are challenged. There is an evident need to incorporate data quality considerations into the whole data cycle, encompassing managerial/governance as well as technical aspects.^ Data quality experts from research and industry agree that a unified framework for data quality management should bring together organizational, architectural and computational approaches. Accordingly, Sadiq structured this handbook in four parts: Part I is on organizational solutions, i.e. the development of data quality objectives for the organization, and the development of strategies to establish roles, processes, policies, and standards required to manage and ensure data quality. Part II, on architectural solutions, covers the technology landscape required to deploy developed data quality management processes, standards and policies. Part III, on computational solutions, presents effective and efficient tools and techniques related to record linkage, lineage and provenance, data uncertainty, and advanced integrity constraints. Finally, Part IV is devoted to case studies of successful data quality initiatives that highlight the various aspects of data quality in action.^ The individual chapters present both an overview of the respective topic in terms of historical research and/or practice and state of the art, as well as specific techniques, methodologies and frameworks developed by the individual contributors. Researchers and students of computer science, information systems, or business management as well as data professionals and practitioners will benefit most from this handbook by not only focusing on the various sections relevant to their research area or particular practical work, but by also studying chapters that they may initially consider not to be directly relevant to them, as there they will learn about new perspectives and approaches.",

PASCAL-XSC provides a large number of predefined data types with arithmetic operators and predefined functions of highestaccuracy for real and complex numbers, for real and complex intervals, and for the corresponding vectors and matrices. Thus PASCAL-XSC makes the computer more powerful concerning the arithmetic. Through an implementation in C, compilers for PASCAL-XSC are available for a large variety of computers such as personal computers, workstations, mainframes, and supercomputers. PASCAL-XSC provides a module concept, an operator concept, functions and operators with general result type, overloading of functions, procedures, and operators, dynamic arrays, access to subarrays, rounding control by the user, and accurate evaluation of expressions. The language is particularly suited for the development of numerical algorithms that deliver highly accurate and automatically verified results. A number of problem-solving routines with automatic resultverification have already been implemented. PASCAL-XSC contains Standard PASCAL. It is immediately usable by PASCAL programmers. PASCAL-XSC is easy to learn and ideal for programming education. The book can be used as a textbook for lectures on computer programming. It contains a major chapter with sample programs, exercises, and solutions. A complete set of syntax diagrams, detailed tables, and indices complete the book.",

        "description": "This book covers all topics relevant for the design of haptic interfaces and teleoperation systems. The book provides the basic knowledge required for understanding more complex approaches and more importantly it introduces all issues that must be considered for designing efficient and safe haptic interfaces. Topics covered in this book provide insight into all relevant components of a haptic system.The reader is guided from understanding the virtual reality concept to the final goal of being able to design haptic interfaces for specific tasks such as nanomanipulation. The introduction chapter positions the haptic interfaces within the virtual reality context. In order to design haptic interfaces that will comply with human capabilities at least basic understanding of human sensors-motor system is required. An overview of this topic is provided in the chapter related to human haptics. The book does not try to introduce the state-of-the-art haptic interface solutions because these tend to change quickly. Only a careful selection of different kinematic configurations is shown to introduce the reader into this field. Mathematical models of virtual environment, collision detection and force rendering topics are strongly interrelated and are described in the next two chapters. The interaction with the virtual environment is simulated with a haptic interface. Impedance and admittance based approaches to haptic robot control are presented. Stability issues of haptic interaction are analyzed in details and solutions are proposed for guaranteeing stable and safe operation. Finally, haptic interaction is extended to teleoperation systems. Virtual fixtures which improve the teleoperation and human-robot cooperation in complex environments are covered next and the last chapter presents nanomanipulation as one specific example of teleoperation.

The 29 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from numerous submissions. The papers cover a wide range of topics related to the history of computing and offer a number of different approaches to making this history relevant. These range from discussion of approaches to describing and analyzing the history through storytelling and education to description of various collections, working installations and reconstruction projects. The papers have been organized in the following topical sections: the importance of storytelling in museums; spotlight on some key collections and their future plans; thoughts on expanding the audience for computing history; spotlight on some research projects; integrating history with computer science education; putting the history of computing into different contexts; celebrating nostalgia for games - and its potential as Trojan horse; the importance and challenges of working installations; and reconstruction stories.",

Multimedia Video-Based Surveillance Systems: Requirements, Issues and Solutions, combines the most recent research results from these areas for use by engineers and end-users involved in the design of surveillance systems in the fields of transportation and services. The book covers emerging surveillance requirements, including new digital sensors for real-time acquisition of surveillance data, low-level image processing algorithms, and event detection methods. It also discusses problems related to knowledge representation in surveillance systems, wireless and wired multimedia networks, and a new generation of surveillance communication tools. Timely information is presented on digital watermarking, broadband multimedia transmission, legal use of surveillance systems, performance evaluation criteria, and other new and emerging topics, along with applications for transports and pedestrian monitoring. The information contained in Multimedia Video-Based Surveillance Systems: Requirements, Issues and Solutions, bridges the distance between present practice and research findings, and the book is an indispensable reference tool for professional engineers.",

Strong emphasis is made on theorems with particularly elegant and informative proofs which may be called gems of the theory. A wide spectrum of most powerful combinatorial tools is presented: methods of extremal set theory, the linear algebra method, the probabilistic method and fragments of Ramsey theory. A throughout discussion of some recent applications to computer science motivates the liveliness and inherent usefulness of these methods to approach problems outside combinatorics. No special combinatorial or algebraic background is assumed. All necessary elements of linear algebra and discrete probability are introduced before their combinatorial applications. Aimed primarily as an introductory text for graduates, it provides also a compact source of modern extremal combinatorics for researchers in computer science and other fields of discrete mathematics.",

        "description": "'In Snap to Grid, an idiosyncratic guide to the interactive, telematic era, Peter Lunenfeld maps out the trajectories that digital technologies have traced upon our cultural imaginary. His evaluation of new media includes an impassioned discussion - informed by the discourses of technology, aesthetics, and cultural theory - of the digital artists, designers, and makers who matter most. 'Snap to grid' is a command that instructs the computer to take hand-drawn lines and plot them precisely in Cartesian space. Users regularly disable this function the moment they open an application because the gains in predictability and accuracy are balanced against the losses of ambiguity and expressiveness. Lunenfeld uses 'snap to grid' as a metaphor for how we manipulate and think about the electronic culture that enfolds us. In this book he snaps his seduction by the machine to the grid of critical thinking.'. 'How can we compare new media to established media? Must we revert to a default dichotomy between utopia and desolation, the notion that media, even digital media, by themselves can redeem or damn us? As he answers these and other questions, Lunenfeld takes into account the post-1989 politico-economic context in which new media have developed and grounds the insights of theory in the constraints of production. Artists discussed include Mark Amerika, Char Davies, Hollis Frampton, William Gibson, Gary Hill, Perry Hoberman, JODI, Christian Moller, Adam Ross, Jennifer Steinkamp, Stelarc, and Diana Thater.'--BOOK JACKET.",

The key problem addressed in the book is the following: how can an embedded systems designer strike a balance between flexibility and efficiency? The book describes how combining hardware design with software design leads to a solution to this important computer engineering problem. The book covers four topics in hardware/software codesign: fundamentals, the design space of custom architectures, the hardware/software interface and application examples. The book comes with an associated design environment that helps the reader to perform experiments in hardware/software codesign.^\nEach chapter also includes exercises and further reading suggestions. Improvements in this second edition include labs and examples using modern FPGA environments from Xilinx and Altera, which make the material applicable to a greater number of courses where these tools are already in use.  More examples and exercises have been added throughout the book and several chapters were expanded and reorganized. “If I were teaching a course on this subject, I would use this as a resource and text. If I were a student who wanted to learn codesign, I would look for a course that at least used a similar approach. If I were an engineer or engineering manager who wanted to learn more about codesign from a very practical perspective, I would read this book first before any other.^\nWhen I first started learning about codesign as a practitioner, a book like this would have been the perfect introduction.”   --Grant Martin, Tensilica-- ·         Teaches embedded systems design, emphasizing the integration of custom hardware components with software. ·         Presents the field of hardware/software codesign in four parts: Basic Concepts, Custom Architecture, Hardware/Software Interfaces, and Applications; ·         Incorporates labs and examples using modern FPGA environments from Xilinx and Altera.",

        "description": "'Explaining how going green can pay for itself, Green Computing: Tools and Techniques for Saving Energy, Money, and Resources ties the green agenda in IT to the broader corporate agenda in risk management, brand management, and reputation management. Written by a leading author in the IT field, this authoritative reference provides easy access to quotable budget justifications that readers can use to place IT stakeholders on the same page for this new agenda that can save valuable resources and the planet.Bringing together everything IT professionals need to know about green computing, the book embodies a new philosophy on how to deploy IT devices, software, and services in a way that makes people more effective with fewer resources. It presents helpful tips on how to maximize energy savings as well as how to present information gradually to allow peers and stakeholders to absorb it.The book's comprehensive coverage includes various types of hardware and software, including the changes currently happening, underlying trends, products currently on the market, and what to expect -- or, in some cases, what organizations should ask for--from suppliers in the future.On the hardware side, the book considers tablet computers -- examining the iPad® and Android®-based tablets. On the software side, it examines the general trend toward cloud computing. It provides important examples of this rapidly emerging trend as well as guidance on how to use the cloud to make software available and to store large amounts of data.Demonstrating the savings and increased business resiliency that can result from green computing, this book offers C-suite executives, senior IT management, project managers, suppliers, and market analysts with the tools required to understand why you need to act, how to act, what to buy, when to do it, and who should act'--",

        "description": "Hypertext/hypermedia systems and user-model-based adaptive systems in the areas of learning and information retrieval have for a long time been considered as two mutually exclusive approaches to information access. Adaptive systems tailor information to the user and may guide the user in the information space to present the most relevant material, taking into account a model of the user's goals, interests and preferences. Hypermedia systems, on the other hand, areuser neutral': they provide the user with the tools and the freedom to explore an information space by browsing through a complex network of information nodes. Adaptive hypertext and hypermedia systems attempt to bridge the gap between these two approaches. Adaptation of hypermedia systems to each individual user is increasingly needed. With the growing size, complexity and heterogeneity of current hypermedia systems, such as the World Wide Web, it becomes virtually impossible to impose guidelines on authors concerning the overall organization of hypermedia information. The networks therefore become so complex and unstructured that the existing navigational tools are no longer powerful enough to provide orientation on where to search for the needed information. It is also not possible to identify appropriate pre-defined paths or subnets for users with certain goals and knowledge backgrounds since the user community of hypermedia systems is usually quite inhomogeneous. This is particularly true for Web-based applications which are expected to be used by a much greater variety of users than any earlier standalone application. A possible remedy for the negative effects of the traditionalone-size-fits-all' approach in the development of hypermedia systems is to equip them with the ability to adapt to the needs of their individual users. A possible way of achieving adaptivity is by modeling the users and tailoring the system's interactions to their goals, tasks and interests. In this sense, the notion of adaptive hypertext/hypermedia comes naturally to denote a hypertext or hypermedia system which reflects some features of the user and/or characteristics of his system usage in a user model, and utilizes this model in order to adapt various behavioral aspects of the system to the user. This book is the first comprehensive publication on adaptive hypertext and hypermedia. It is oriented towards researchers and practitioners in the fields of hypertext and hypermedia, information systems, and personalized systems. It is also an important resource for the numerous developers of Web-based applications. The design decisions, adaptation methods, and experience presented in this book are a unique source of ideas and techniques for developing more usable and more intelligent Web-based systems suitable for a great variety of users. The practitioners will find it important that many of the adaptation techniques presented in this book have proved to be efficient and are ready to be used in various applications.",

Although written for beginners, experienced researchers in areas involving bioinformatics and computational biology may benefit from numerous tips and tricks that help to process, filter and format large datasets. Learning by doing is the basic concept of this book. Worked examples illustrate how to employ data processing and analysis techniques, e.g. for - finding proteins potentially causing pathogenicity in bacteria, - supporting the significance of BLAST with homology modeling, or - detecting candidate proteins that may be redox-regulated, on the basis of their structure. All the software tools and datasets used are freely available. One section is devoted to explaining setup and maintenance of Linux as an operating system independent virtual machine. The author's experiences and knowledge gained from working and teaching in both academia and industry constitute the foundation for this practical approach. ",

The primary aim is to develop algorithmic thinking-emphasizing long-living computational concepts over fast changing software issues. The guiding principle is to explain modern numerical analysis concepts applicable in complex scientific computing at much simpler model problems. For example, the two adaptive techniques in numerical quadrature elaborated here carry the germs for either exploration methods or multigrid methods in differential equations, which are not treated here. The presentation draws on geometrical intuition wherever appropriate, supported by large number of illustrations. Numerous exercises are included for further practice and improved understanding. This text will appeal to undergraduate and graduate students as well as researchers in mathematics, computer science, science, and engineering. At the same time, it is addressed to practical computational scientists who, via self-study, wish to become acquainted with modern concepts of numerical analysis and scientific computing on an elementary level. The sole prerequisite is undergraduate knowledge in linear algebra and calculus.",

In this book, the editors present a collection of invited chapters from various fields related to domain engineering. The individual chapters present state-of-the-art research and are organized in three parts. The first part focuses on results that deal with domain engineering in software product lines. The second part describes how domain-specific languages are used to support the construction and deployment of domains. Finally, the third part presents contributions dealing with domain engineering within the field of conceptual modeling. All chapters utilize a similar terminology, which will help readers to understand and relate to the chapters content. The book will be especially rewarding for researchers and students of software engineering methodologies in general and of  domain engineering and its related fields in particular, as it contains the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on this topic.",

Overall the book gives a very effective hands-on coverage of Fortran, valuable to students and practitioners alike. Ian Chivers and Jane Sleightholme are the joint owners of comp-fortran-90, which is a lively forum for the exchange of technical details of the Fortran language. Both authors have been involved in teaching and supporting Fortran and related areas for over 20 years and their latest book reflects the lessons that have been learnt from their experience with Fortran over the last few years.",

But searching them for information can still be painful. Searches often return either large numbers of matches or no suitable matches at all. Such document collections can vary a lot in size and how much structure they carry. What they have in common is that they typically do have some structure and that they cover a limited range of topics. The second point is significantly different from the Web in general. The type of search system that we propose in this book can suggest ways of refining or relaxing the query to assist a user in the search process. In order to suggest sensible query modifications we would need to know what the documents are about. Explicit knowledge about the document collection encoded in some electronic form is what we need. However, typically such knowledge is not available. So we construct it automatically.",

        "description": "This book is an introduction to level set methods and dynamic implicit surfaces. These are powerful techniques for analyzing and computing moving fronts in a variety of different settings. While the book gives many examples of the usefulness of the methods for a diverse set of applications, it also gives complete numerical analysis and recipes, which will enable users to quickly apply the techniques to real problems. The book begins with the description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, and then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, reinitialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method, and the motion of codimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the field of image processing and computer vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to computational physics. It begins with one-phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke; free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water; and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change it's topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful.",

        "description": "Finite model theory has its origins in classical model theory, but owes its systematic development to research from complexity theory. The book presents the main results of descriptive complexity theory, that is, the connections between axiomatizability of classes of finite structures and their complexity with respect to time and space bounds. The logics that are important in this context include fixed-point logics, transitive closure logics, and also certain infinitary languages; their model theory is studied in full detail. Other topics include DATALOG languages, quantifiers and oracles, 0-1 laws, and optimization and approximation problems. The book is written in such a way that the resp. parts on model theory and descriptive complexity theory may be read independently.",

Among the new topics included are, for example, polyhedral metric space, nearness matrix problems, distances between belief assignments, distance-related animal settings, diamond-cutting distances, natural units of length, Heidegger’s de-severance distance, and brain distances. The publication of this volume coincides with intensifying research efforts into metric spaces and especially distance design for applications. Accurate metrics have become a crucial goal in computational biology, image analysis, speech recognition and information retrieval. Leaving aside the practical questions that arise during the selection of a ‘good’ distance function, this work focuses on providing the research community with an invaluable comprehensive listing of the main available distances. As well as providing standalone introductions and definitions, the encyclopedia facilitates swift cross-referencing with easily navigable bold-faced textual links to core entries. In addition to distances themselves, the authors have collated numerous fascinating curiosities in their Who’s Who of metrics, including distance-related notions and paradigms that enable applied mathematicians in other sectors to deploy research tools that non-specialists justly view as arcane. In expanding access to these techniques, and in many cases enriching the context of distances themselves, this peerless volume is certain to stimulate fresh research.",

        "description": "The Innovators is Walter Isaacson's revealing story of the people who created the computer and the Internet. It is also a history of the digital revolution and a guide to how innovation really happens. What were the talents that allowed certain inventors and entrepreneurs to turn their visionary ideas into disruptive realities? What led to their creative leaps? Why did some succeed and others fail? Isaacson begins with Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron's daughter, who pioneered computer programming in the 1840s. He explores the fascinating personalities that created our current digital revolution, such as Vannevar Bush, Alan Turing, John von Neumann, J.C.R. Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, Tim Berners-Lee, and Larry Page. This is the story of how their minds worked and what made them so inventive. It's also a narrative of how their ability to collaborate and master the art of teamwork made them even more creative. For an era that seeks to foster innovation, creativity, and teamwork, The Innovators shows how they happen.--",

        "description": "Multivariate public key cryptosystems (MPKC) is a fast-developing new area in cryptography. In the past 10 years, MPKC schemes have increasingly been seen as a possible alternative to number theoretic-based cryptosystems such as RSA, as they are generally more efficient in terms of computational effort. As quantum computers are developed, MPKC will become a necessary alternative. Multivariate Public Key Cryptosystems systematically presents the subject matter for a broad audience. Information security experts in industry can use the book as a guide for understanding what is needed to implement these cryptosystems for practical applications, and researchers in both computer science and mathematics will find this book a good starting point for exploring this new field. It is also suitable as a textbook for advanced-level students. Written more from a computational perspective, the authors provide the necessary mathematical theory behind MPKC; students with some previous exposure to abstract algebra will be well-prepared to read and understand the material.",

It highlights topological and structural aspects of general semi-infinite programming, formulates powerful optimality conditions, which take this structure into account, and gives a conceptually new bi-level solution method. The results are motivated and illustrated by a number of problems from engineering and economics that give rise to semi-infinite models, including (reverse) Chebyshev approximation, minimax problems, robust optimization, design centering, defect minimization problems for operator equations, and disjunctive programming. Audience: The book is suitable for graduate students and researchers in the fields of optimization and operations research.",

Throughout the thirteen chapters authors address key questions concerning how collaboration can be improved by using DUIs, including: in which situations a DUI is suitable to ease the collaboration among users; how usability standards can be used to evaluate the usability of systems based on DUIs; and accurately describe case studies and prototypes implementing these concerns. Under a collaborative scenario, users sharing common goals may take advantage of DUI environments to carry out their tasks more successfully because DUIs provide a shared environment where the users are allowed to manipulate information in the same space and at the same time. Under this hypothesis, collaborative DUI scenarios open new challenges to usability evaluation techniques and methods. Distributed User Interfaces: Collaboration and Usability presents an integrated view of different approaches related to Collaboration and Usability in Distributed User Interface settings, which demonstrate the state of the art, as well as future directions in this novel and rapidly evolving subject area.",

        "description": "This book is supposed to serve as a comprehensive and instructive guide through the new world of digital communication. On the physical layer optical and electrical cabling technology are described as well as wireless communication technologies. On the data link layer local area networks (LANs) are introduced together with the most popular LAN technologies such as Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, and ATM as well as wireless LAN technologies including IEEE 802.x, Bluetooth, or ZigBee. A wide range of WAN technologies are covered including contemporary high speed technologies like PDH and SDH up to high speed wireless WANs (WiMAX) and 4th generation wireless telephone networks LTE. Routing technologies conclude the treatment of the data link layer. Next, there is the Internet layer with the Internet protocol IP that establishes a virtual uniform network out of the net of heterogeneous networks. In detail, both versions, IPv4 as well as the successor IPv6 are covered in detail as well as ICMP, NDP, and Mobile IP. In the subsequent transport layer protocol functions are provided to offer a connection-oriented and reliable transport service on the basis of the simple and unreliable IP. The basic protocols TCP and UDP are introduced as well as NAT, the network address translation. Beside transport layer security protocols like SSL and TLS are presented. On the upmost application layer popular Internet application protocols are described like DNS, SMTP, PGP, (S)FTP, NFS, SSH, DHCP, SNMP, RTP, RTCP, RTSP, and World Wide Web.",

        "description": "In the modern age of almost universal computer usage, practically every individual in a technologically developed society has routine access to the most up-to-date cryptographic technology that exists, the so-called RSA public-key cryptosystem. A major component of this system is the factorization of large numbers into their primes. Thus an ancient number-theory concept now plays a crucial role in communication among millions of people who may have little or no knowledge of even elementary mathematics. Hans Riesel’s highly successful first edition of this book has now been enlarged and updated with the goal of satisfying the needs of researchers, students, practitioners of cryptography, and non-scientific readers with a mathematical inclination. It includes important advances in computational prime number theory and in factorization as well as re-computed and enlarged tables, accompanied by new tables reflecting current research by both the author and his coworkers and by independent researchers. The book treats four fundamental problems: the number of primes below a given limit, the approximate number of primes, the recognition of primes and the factorization of large numbers. The author provides explicit algorithms and computer programs, and has attempted to discuss as many of the classically important results as possible, as well as the most recent discoveries. The programs include are written in PASCAL to allow readers to translate the programs into the language of their own computers. The independent structure of each chapter of the book makes it highly readable for a wide variety of mathematicians, students of applied number theory, and others interested in both study and research in number theory and cryptography.",

        "description": "The field of structured P2P systems has seen fast growth upon the introduction of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) in the early 2000s. The first proposals, including Chord, Pastry, Tapestry, were gradually improved to cope with scalability, locality and security issues. By utilizing the processing and bandwidth resources  of end users, the P2P approach enables high performance of data distribution which is hard to achieve with traditional client-server architectures. The P2P computing community is also being actively utilized for software updates to the Internet, P2PSIP VoIP, video-on-demand, and distributed backups. The recent introduction of the identifier-locator split proposal for future Internet architectures poses another important application for DHTs, namely mapping between host permanent identity and changing IP address. The growing complexity and scale of modern P2P systems requires the introduction of hierarchy and intelligence in routing of requests.^ Structured Peer-to-Peer Systemscovers fundamental issues in organization, optimization, and tradeoffs of present large-scale structured P2P systems, as well as, provides principles, analytical models, and simulation methods applicable in designing future systems. Part I presents the state-of-the-art of structured P2P systems, popular DHT topologies and protocols, and the design challenges for efficient P2P network topology organization, routing, scalability, and security. Part II shows that local strategies with limited knowledge per peer provide the highest scalability level subject to reasonable performance and security constraints. Although the strategies are local, their efficiency is due to elements of hierarchical organization, which appear in many DHT designs that traditionally are considered as flat ones.^\nPart III describes methods to gradually enhance the local view limit when a peer is capable to operate with larger knowledge, still partial, about the entire system. These methods were formed in the evolution of hierarchical organization from flat DHT networks to hierarchical DHT architectures, look-ahead routing, and topology-aware ranking. Part IV highlights some known P2P-based experimental systems and commercial applications in the modern Internet. The discussion clarifies the importance of P2P technology for building present and future Internet systems.",

        "description": "The considerable influence of inherent uncertainties on structural behavior has led the engineering community to recognize the importance of a stochastic approach to structural problems. Issues related to uncertainty quantification and its influence on the reliability of the computational models are continuously gaining in significance. In particular, the problems of dynamic response analysis and reliability assessment of structures with uncertain system and excitation parameters have been the subject of continuous research over the last two decades as a result of the increasing availability of powerful computing resources and technology.  This book is a follow up of a previous book with the same subject (ISBN 978-90-481-9986-0) and focuses on advanced computational methods and software tools which can highly assist in tackling complex problems in stochastic dynamic/seismic analysis and design of structures. The selected chapters are authored by some of the most active scholars in their respective areas and represent some of the most recent developments in this field.  The book consists of 21 chapters which can be grouped into several thematic topics including dynamic analysis of stochastic systems, reliability-based design, structural control and health monitoring, model updating, system identification, wave propagation in random media, seismic fragility analysis and damage assessment.  This edited book is primarily intended for researchers and post-graduate students who are familiar with the fundamentals and wish to study or to advance the state of the art on a particular topic in the field of computational stochastic structural dynamics. Nevertheless, practicing engineers could benefit as well from it as most code provisions tend to incorporate probabilistic concepts in the analysis and design of structures. ",

        "description": "Algorithms and Programming is primarily intended for a first-year undergraduate course in programming. It is structured in a problem-solution format that requires the student to think through the programming process, thus developing an understanding of the underlying theory. Although the author assumes some moderate familiarity with programming constructs, the book is easily readable by a student taking a basic introductory course in computer science. In addition, the more advanced chapters make the book useful for a course at the graduate level in the analysis of algorithms and/or compiler construction. Each chapter is more or less independent, containing classical and well-known problems supplemented by clear and in-depth explanations. The material covered includes such topics as combinatorics, sorting, searching, queues, grammar and parsing, selected well-known algorithms and much more. Students and teachers will find this both an excellent text for learning programming and a source of problems for a variety of courses. The book is addressed both to ambitious students and instructors looking for interesting problems [and] fulfills this task perfectly, especially if the reader has a good mathematical background. — Zentralblatt MATH This book is intended for students, engineers, and other people who want to improve their computer skills.... The chapters can be read independently. Throughout the book, useful exercises give readers a feeling for how to apply the theory. The author provides answers to the exercises. — Computing Reviews This book contains a collection of problems and their solutions. Most of the problems are of the type that would be encountered in a course on data structures or compilers.... The book will prove useful for those who need homework or test questions for the areas covered by it. Many of the questions are formulated in such a way that producing variants on them can be done with ease.... Overall...the book is well done. I recommend it to teachers and those wishing to sharpen their data structure and compiler skills. — SIGACT News",

The investigations are carried out in elastic range. The basic assumption here is the  thin plate theory. This method is used to determination the buckling load and postbuckling analysis of thin-walled structures subjected to static and dynamic load. The book introduces two methods for static and dynamic buckling investigation which allow for a wider understanding of the phenomenon. Two different methods also can allow uncoupling of the phenomena occurring at the same time and attempt to estimate their impact on the final result. A general mathematical model, adopted in proposed analytical-numerical method, enables the consideration of all types of stability loss i.e.local, global and interactive forms of buckling. The applied numerical-numerical method includes adjacent of walls, shear-lag phenomenon and a deplanation of cross-sections.",

        "description": "This introduction to programming places computer science in the core of a liberal arts education. Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process. This approach fosters a variety of skills -- critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail -- that are important for everyone, not just future computer programmers. The book exposes readers to two fundamentally new ideas. First, it presents program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement; how to formulate concise goals; how to make up examples; how to develop an outline of the solution, based on the analysis; how to finish the program; and how to test. Each step produces a well-defined intermediate product. Second, the book comes with a novel programming environment, the first one explicitly designed for beginners. The environment grows with the readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks. - Publisher.",

        "description": "Since the release of the first internet phone in 1995, the use of voice over internet protocol (VoIP) has grown exponentially, so that today it is an established and popular technology for real-time communications in both business and daily life. ThisGuide to Voice and Video over IPintroduces the fundamental techniques underpinning the huge success and global penetration of VoIP. After highlighting the benefits and growing importance of VoIP, the text presents a review of the latest advances in speech and video compression, computer networking protocols, the assessment and monitoring of VoIP quality, and next generation network architectures for multimedia services. Numerous practical examples, complete with real trace data, illustrate and explain the concepts.^\nThe book also concludes with three case studies, each presenting easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions together with challenging hands-on exercises. Topics and features: This teaching lab and classroom-tested textbook/guide is ideal for final-year undergraduate and first-year postgraduate courses in computer science and electronic engineering. Engineers in industry, and others with a general interest in VoIP, will also find this an invaluable practical reference.

        "description": "Collective view prediction is to judge the opinions of an active web user based on unknown elements by referring to the collective mind of the whole community. Content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering are two mainstream collective view prediction techniques. They generate predictions by analyzing the text features of the target object or the similarity of users’ past behaviors. Still, these techniques are vulnerable to the artificially-injected noise data, because they are not able to judge the reliability and credibility of the information sources. Trust-based Collective View Prediction describes new approaches for tackling this problem by utilizing users’ trust relationships from the perspectives of fundamental theory, trust-based collective view prediction algorithms and real case studies. The book consists of two main parts – a theoretical foundation and an algorithmic study.^ The first part will review several basic concepts and methods related to collective view prediction, such as state-of-the-art recommender systems, sentimental analysis, collective view, trust management, the Relationship of Collective View and Trustworthy, and trust in collective view prediction. In the second part, the authors present their models and algorithms based on a quantitative analysis of more than 300 thousand users’ data from popular product-reviewing websites. They also introduce two new trust-based prediction algorithms, one collaborative algorithm based on the second-order Markov random walk model, and one Bayesian fitting model for combining multiple predictors.^ The discussed concepts, developed algorithms, empirical results, evaluation methodologies and the robust analysis framework described in Trust-based Collective View Prediction will not only provide valuable insights and findings to related research communities and peers, but also showcase the great potential to encourage industries and business partners to integrate these techniques into new applications.",

        "description": "Human Language Technology (HLT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems have typically focused on the “factual” aspect of content analysis. Other aspects, including pragmatics, opinion, and style, have received much less attention. However, to achieve an adequate understanding of a text, these aspects cannot be ignored. The chapters in this book address the aspect of subjective opinion, which includes identifying different points of view, identifying different emotive dimensions, and classifying text by opinion. Various conceptual models and computational methods are presented. The models explored in this book include the following: distinguishing attitudes from simple factual assertions; distinguishing between the author’s reports from reports of other people’s opinions; and distinguishing between explicitly and implicitly stated attitudes. In addition, many applications are described that promise to benefit from the ability to understand attitudes and affect, including indexing and retrieval of documents by opinion; automatic question answering about opinions; analysis of sentiment in the media and in discussion groups about consumer products, political issues, etc. ; brand and reputation management; discovering and predicting consumer and voting trends; analyzing client discourse in therapy and counseling; determining relations between scientific texts by finding reasons for citations; generating more appropriate texts and making agents more believable; and creating writers’ aids. The studies reported here are carried out on different languages such as English, French, Japanese, and Portuguese. Difficult challenges remain, however. It can be argued that analyzing attitude and affect in text is an “NLP”-complete problem.",

        "description": "Economic Modeling Using Artificial Intelligence Methods examines the application of artificial intelligence methods to model economic data. Traditionally, economic modeling has been modeled in the linear domain where the principles of superposition are valid. The application of artificial intelligence for economic modeling allows for a flexible multi-order non-linear modeling. In addition, game theory has largely been applied in economic modeling. However, the inherent limitation of game theory when dealing with many player games encourages the use of multi-agent systems for modeling economic phenomena.The artificial intelligence techniques used to model economic data include:multi-layer perceptron neural networksradial basis functionssupport vector machinesrough setsgenetic algorithmparticle swarm optimizationsimulated annealingmulti-agent systemincremental learningfuzzy networksSignal processing techniques are explored to analyze economic data, and these techniques are the time domain methods, time-frequency domain methods and fractals dimension approaches. Interesting economic problems such as causality versus correlation, simulating the stock market, modeling and controling inflation, option pricing, modeling economic growth as well as portfolio optimization are examined. The relationship between economic dependency and interstate conflict is explored, and knowledge on how economics is useful to foster peace – and vice versa – is investigated. Economic Modeling Using Artificial Intelligence Methods deals with the issue of causality in the non-linear domain and applies the automatic relevance determination, the evidence framework, Bayesian approach and Granger causality to understand causality and correlation.Economic Modeling Using Artificial Intelligence Methods makes an important contribution to the area of econometrics, and is a valuable source of reference for graduate students, researchers and financial practitioners.",

        "description": "Introducing Spoken Dialogue Systems into Intelligent Environmentsoutlines the formalisms of a novel knowledge-driven framework for spoken dialogue management and presents the implementation of a model-based Adaptive Spoken Dialogue Manager(ASDM) called OwlSpeak. The authors have identified three stakeholders that potentially influence the behavior of the ASDM: the user, the SDS, and a complex Intelligent Environment (IE) consisting of various devices, services, and task descriptions.The theoretical foundation of a working ontology-based spoken dialogue description framework, the prototype implementation of the ASDM, and the evaluation activities that are presented as part of this book contribute to the ongoing spoken dialogue research by establishing the fertile ground of model-based adaptive spoken dialogue management.This monograph is ideal for advanced undergraduate students, PhD students, and postdocs as well as academic and industrial researchers and developers in speech and multimodal interactive systems.",

        "description": "Defining a new development life-cycle methodology, together with a set of associated techniques and tools to develop highly critical systems using formal  techniques, this book adopts a rigorous safety assessment approach explored via several layers (from  requirements analysis to automatic source code generation). This is assessed and evaluated via a standard case study: the cardiac pacemaker. Additionally a formalisation of an Electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to identify anomalies  in order to improve existing medical protocols. This allows the key issue  - that formal methods are not currently integrated into established critical systems development processes - to be discussed in a highly effective and informative way. Using Event-B for Critical Device Software Systems serves as a valuable resource for researchers and students of formal methods. The assessment of critical systems development is applicable to all industries, but engineers and physicians from the health domain will find the cardiac pacemaker case study of particular value.",

It offers an overview of the fundamentals of diagnosisprognosis and hybrid bond graph modeling. This book also describes hybrid bond graph-based quantitative fault detection, isolation and estimation. Moreover, it also presents strategies to track the system mode and predict the remaining useful life under multiple fault condition. A real world complex hybrid system—a vehicle steering control system—is studied using the developed fault diagnosis methods to show practical significance. Readers of this book will benefit from easy-to-understand fundamentals of bond graph models, concepts of health monitoring, fault diagnosis and failure prognosis, as well as hybrid systems.  The reader will gain knowledge of fault detection and isolation in complex systems including those with hybrid nature, and will learn state-of-the-art developments in theory and technologies of fault diagnosis and failure prognosis for complex systems.",

        "description": "Although there has been much progress in developing theories, models and systems in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Vision Processing (VP) there has heretofore been little progress on integrating these subareas of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This book contains a set of edited papers addressing computational models and systems for the integration of NLP and VP. The papers focus on site descriptions such as that of the large Japanese $500 million Real World Computing (RWC) project, on historical philosophical issues, on systems which have been built and which integrate the processing of visual scenes together with language about them, and on spatial relations which appear to be the key to integration. The U.S.A., Japan and the EU are well reflected, showing up the fact that integration is a truly international issue. There is no doubt that all of this will be necessary for the InformationSuperHighways of the future.",

        "description": "AVVISO IMPORTANTE! Springer desidera informare i propri lettori che è stata sostituita l'edizione del volume con ISBN 978-88-470-2747-3 (fallata a causa di un errore generato da Springer in fase di compilazione dei file LateX forniti dall'Autore) con l'edizione corretta dotata del NUOVO ISBN 978-88-470-5255-0.   Ci scusiamo con tutti i nostri lettori, e con l'Autore, per il disagio.In questo testo si introducono i concetti di base per la modellistica numerica di problemi differenziali alle derivate parziali. Si considerano le classiche equazioni lineari ellittiche, paraboliche ed iperboliche, ma anche altre equazioni, quali quelle di diffusione e trasporto, di Navier-Stokes e le leggi di conservazione;  si forniscono inoltre numerosi esempi fisici che stanno alla base di tali equazioni. Quindi si analizzano metodi di risoluzione numerica basati su elementi finiti (continui e discontinui), differenze finite, volumi finiti, metodi spettrali (continui e discontinui), nonché strategie di approssimazione più avanzate basate sui metodi di decomposizione di domini o quelli di risoluzione di problemi di controllo ottimale. In particolare vengono discussi gli aspetti algoritmici e di implementazione al calcolatore e si forniscono diversi programmi di semplice utilizzo. Il testo non presuppone una approfondita conoscenza matematica delle equazioni alle derivate parziali: i concetti rigorosamente indispensabili al riguardo sono riportati nell'Appendice. Esso è pertanto adatto agli studenti dei corsi di laurea di indirizzo scientifico (Ingegneria, Matematica, Fisica, Scienze dell'Informazione) e consigliabile a ricercatori del mondo accademico ed extra-accademico che vogliano avvicinarsi a questo interessante ramo della matematica applicata e delle scienze computazionali.",

Despite recent impressive results when simulating and rendering thousands of individuals, many challenges still exist in this area. The comparison of simulation with reality, the realistic appearance of virtual humans and their behavior, group structure and their motion, and collision avoidance are just some examples of these challenges. For most of the applications of crowds, it is now a requirement to have real-time simulations – which is an additional challenge, particularly when crowds are very large. Crowd Simulationanalyses these challenges in depth and suggests many possible solutions. Daniel Thalmann and Soraia Musse share their experiences and expertise in the application of: The second edition presents techniques and methods developed since the authors first covered the simulation of crowds in 2007.Crowd Simulationincludes in-depth discussions on the techniques of path planning, including a new hybrid approach between navigation graphs and potential-based methods. The importance of gaze attention – individuals appearing conscious of their environment and of others – is introduced, and a free-of-collision method for crowds is also discussed. ",

        "description": "This book is concerned with the emerging field of High Performance Reconfigurable Computing (HPRC), which aims to harness the high performance and relative low power of reconfigurable hardware–in the form Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)–in High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. It presents the latest developments in this field from applications, architecture, and tools and methodologies points of view. We hope that this work will form a reference for existing researchers in the field, and entice new researchers and developers to join the HPRC community.  The book includes:  Thirteen application chapters which present the most important application areas tackled by high performance reconfigurable computers, namely: financial computing, bioinformatics and computational biology, data search and processing, stencil computation e.g. computational fluid dynamics and seismic modeling, cryptanalysis, astronomical N-body simulation, and circuit simulation.     Seven architecture chapters which present both commercial and academic parallel FPGA architectures, low latency and high performance FPGA-based networks and memory architectures for parallel machines, and a high speed optical dynamic reconfiguration mechanism for HPRC.  Five tools and methodologies chapters which address the important issue of productivity and high performance in HPRC. These include a study of precision and arithmetic issues in HPRC, comparative studies of C-based high level synthesis tools and RTL-based approaches, taxonomy of HPRC tools and a framework of their analysis, and an integrated hardware-software-application approach to HPRC.",

        "description": "Innovations in hardware architecture, like hyper-threading or multicore processors, mean that parallel computing resources are available for inexpensive desktop computers. In only a few years, many standard software products will be based on concepts of parallel programming implemented on such hardware, and the range of applications will be much broader than that of scientific computing, up to now the main application area for parallel computing. Rauber and Rünger take up these recent developments in processor architecture by giving detailed descriptions of parallel programming techniques that are necessary for developing efficient programs for multicore processors as well as for parallel cluster systems and supercomputers. Their book is structured in three main parts, covering all areas of parallel computing: the architecture of parallel systems, parallel programming models and environments, and the implementation of efficient application algorithms. The emphasis lies on parallel programming techniques needed for different architectures. For this second edition, all chapters have been carefully revised. The chapter on architecture of parallel systems has been updated considerably, with a greater emphasis on the architecture of multicore systems and adding new material on the latest developments in computer architecture. Lastly, a completely new chapter on general-purpose GPUs and the corresponding programming techniques has been added. The main goal of the book is to present parallel programming techniques that can be used in many situations for a broad range of application areas and which enable the reader to develop correct and efficient parallel programs. Many examples and exercises are provided to show how to apply the techniques. The book can be used as both a textbook for students and a reference book for professionals. The material presented has been used for courses in parallel programming at different universities for many years.",

        "description": "Software Engineering Techniques Applied to Agricultural Systems presents cutting-edge software engineering techniques for designing and implementing better agricultural software systems based on the object-oriented paradigm and the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The book is divided in two parts: The first part presents concepts of the object-oriented paradigm and the UML notation of these concepts, and the second part provides a number of examples of applications that use the material presented in the first part. The examples presented illustrate the techniques discussed, focusing on how to construct better models using objects and UML diagrams. More advanced concepts such as distributed systems and examples of how to build these systems are presented in the last chapter of the book. The book presents a step-by-step approach for modeling agricultural systems, starting with a conceptual diagram representing elements of the system and their relationships. Furthermore, diagrams such as sequential and collaboration diagrams are used to explain the dynamic and static aspects of the software system. Audience This book is intended for anyone involved in software development projects in agriculture, including managers, team leaders, developers and modellers of agricultural and environmental systems.",

        "description": "This textbook is an introduction to Scientific Computing, in which several numerical methods for the computer-based solution of certain classes of mathematical problems are illustrated. The authors show how to compute the zeros, the extrema, and the integrals of continuous functions, solve linear systems, approximate functions using polynomials and construct accurate approximations for the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. To make the format concrete and appealing, the programming environments Matlab and Octave are adopted as faithful companions. The book contains the solutions to several problems posed in exercises and examples, often originating from important applications. At the end of each chapter, a specific section is devoted to subjects which were not addressed in the book and contains bibliographical references for a more comprehensive treatment of the material. From the review: '.... This carefully written textbook, the third English edition, contains substantial new developments on the numerical solution of differential equations. It is typeset in a two-color design and is written in a style suited for readers who have mathematics, natural sciences, computer sciences or economics as a background and who are interested in a well-organized introduction to the subject.'

It includes many topics important in current research that are not found in other basic analysis books. It begins with a comparison of real numbers viewed as a totally ordered field or, alternatively, constructed using the Dedekind cut method. Properties surrounding real numbers are explored and many interesting relationships are proven using mathematical induction. Functions are then developed with special emphasis on topics such as asymptotics, n-levels of composition and periodicity of certain functions. Sequences and series for both the discrete and continuous case are concurrently developed showing contrast wherever possible. The order of growth for sequences diverging to infinity is incorporated with its counterpart given for functions. The usual properties of functions, together with their limit theory including the differential calculus are compared carefully with examples illustrating their fundamental properties. The graphs of these functions are then closely studied giving as much detail as possible for a wide variety of functions. Audience: Undergraduate and graduate students in all areas of mathematical science and its applications.",

        "description": "People use the word strategy in a variety of different contexts. The term has connotations ranging from statesmanship to economic planning, and has become pervasive in the social sciences. We also talk about 'problem solving strategies' and 'corporate strategy' in a large business enterprise. The concept of strategy applies whenever a sequence of goal-oriented actions is based on large-scale and long-range planning. This monograph gives a systematic overview of the theory of strategies, a new area of enquiry developed over the past two decades by the author and his team. The projects described have clearly defined research objectives and are based on realistic assumptions about the environments in which the programming systems will work, and about the constraints and requirements they have to satisfy. Applications of the systems range over various aspects of air traffic control, automatic verification and validation of discrete-event simulation models, econometric model building, distributed planning systems for manufacturing, control of traffic lights, and others. The book is aimed at researchers, teachers and students in computer science, management science and certain areas of engineering. The reader should have some maturity in computer science and mathematics, and familiarity with the basic concepts of artificial intelligence.",

        "description": "Research in intelligent interactive systems can offer valuable assistance to elderly and disabled populations by helping them to achieve greater levels of engagement with the world. Many users find it difficult to use existing interaction devices, either for physical or age-related impairments. However, research on intelligent voice recognition, adaptable pointing, browsing and navigation, and affect and gesture recognition can hugely benefit such users. Additionally, systems and services developed for elderly or disabled people often find useful applications for their able-bodied counterparts. A Multimodal End-2-End Approach to Accessible Computing illustrates the state-of-the-art of technology and presents a vision for accessibility in the near future. It considers challenges faced by accessibility practitioners at research institutes, industries and legislative institutions throughout the world, and explores the different phases of delivering accessible products and services through design, development, deployment and maintenance. A collection of eminent researchers cover topics on developing and standardizing user models for inclusive design, adaptable multimodal system development for digital TV and ubiquitous devices. With a foreword from the BBC’s Head of Technology and organiser of the Switchover Help Scheme, and an End Note from the chairman of the ITU-T’s Focus Group on Audiovisual Media Accessibility (presenting a vision for accessible computing), this book will be an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners.",

Vast new applications to data security are one explanation for this. Perhaps a more important reason for the huge growth of scientific research on cryptography is the seminal idea of public-key cryptography and the resulting new vistas on the possibilities of communication. This book gives a broad overview of public-key cryptography, covering its essence and advantages, various public-key cryptosystems and protocols. It also gives a comprehensive introduction to classical cryptography and cryptanalysis. The book is self-contained and suitable both as a text and as a reference. It starts from the beginning but also includes some 1989 developments. The presentation is in many ways new, with some new results. The treatment is rigorous but avoids unnecessary formalism. The plaintext examples in the book form a package of basic sauna knowledge.",

        "description": "Cognition Beyond the Brain challenges neurocentrism by advocating a systemic view of cognition based on investigating how action shapes the experience of thinking. The systemic view steers between extended functionalism and enactivism by stressing how living beings connect bodies, technologies, language and culture. Since human thinking depends on a cultural ecology, people connect biologically-based powers with extended systems and, by so doing, they constitute cognitive systems that reach across the skin. Biological interpretation exploits extended functional systems. Illustrating distributed cognition, one set of chapters focus on computer mediated trust, work at a construction site, judgement aggregation and crime scene investigation. Turning to how bodies manufacture skills, the remaining chapters focus on interactivity or sense-saturated coordination. The feeling of doing is crucial to solving maths problems, learning about X rays, finding an invoice number, or launching a warhead in a film.  People both participate in extended systems and exert individual responsibility. Brains manufacture a now to which selves are anchored: people can act automatically or, at times, vary habits and choose to author actions. In ontogenesis, a systemic view permits rationality to be seen as gaining mastery over world-side resources. Much evidence and argument thus speaks for reconnecting the study of computation, interactivity and human artifice. Taken together, this can drive a networks revolution that gives due cognitive importance to the perceivable world that lies beyond the brain. Cognition Beyond the Brain is a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners and graduate students within the fields of Computer Science, Psychology, Linguistics and Cognitive Science.",

This handbook, intended as a crime science manifesto, showcases the scope of the crime science field and provides the reader with an understanding of the assumptions, aspirations and methods of crime science, as well as the variety of topics that fall within its purview. Crime science provides a distinctive approach to understanding and dealing with crime: one that is outcome-oriented, evidence-based and that crosses boundaries between disciplines. The central mission of crime science is to find new ways to cut crime and increase security. Beginning by setting out the case for crime science, the editors examine the roots of crime science in environmental criminology and describe its key features. The book is then divided into two sections. The first section comprises chapters by disciplinary specialists about the contributions their sciences can make or have already made to crime science. The second section of the book comprises a series of exemplary case studies in crime science, showing a wide range of the kind of work that crime scientists do. The editors conclude by drawing on the preceding contributions, as well as germane areas of research, to offer a thoughtful consideration of future directions for crime science. This book is essential reading for social scientists and scientists alike and marks a new phase in the study of crime and its detection and prevention.",

Computer scientists, specifically, approach this field based on their practical experiences in managing large amounts of data, and with far fewer assumptions– the data can be of any type, structured or unstructured, and may be extremely large.Outlier Analysisis a comprehensive exposition, as understood by data mining experts, statisticians and computer scientists. The book has been organized carefully, and emphasis was placed on simplifying the content, so that students and practitioners can also benefit. Chapters will typically cover one of three areas: methods and techniques  commonly used in outlier analysis, such as linear methods, proximity-based methods, subspace methods, and supervised methods; data  domains, such as, text, categorical, mixed-attribute, time-series, streaming, discrete sequence, spatial and network data; and key applications of these methods as applied to diverse domains such as  credit card fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, earth science, web log analytics, and social network analysis are covered.",

However, as the number of components on a single chip and their performance continue to increase, the communication architecture plays a major role in the area, performance and energy consumption of the overall system. As a result, a shift from computation-based to communication-based design becomes mandatory. Towards this end, network-on-chip (NoC) communication architectures have emerged recently as a promising alternative to classical bus and point-to-point communication architectures.This book explores outstanding research problems related to modeling, analysis and optimization of NoC communication architectures. More precisely, we present novel design methodologies, software tools and FPGA prototypes to aid the design of application-specific NoCs.",

        "description": "Information visualization is the act of gaining insight into data, and is carried out by virtually everyone. It is usually facilitated by turning data – often a collection of numbers – into images that allow much easier comprehension. Everyone benefits from information visualization, whether internet shopping, investigating fraud or indulging an interest in art. So no assumptions are made about specialist background knowledge in, for example, computer science, mathematics, programming or human cognition.  Indeed, the book is directed at two main audiences. One comprises first year students of any discipline. The other comprises graduates – again of any discipline – who are taking a one- or two-year course of training to be visual and interaction designers. By focusing on the activity of design the pedagogical approach adopted by the book is based on the view that the best way to learn about the subject is to do it, to be creative: not to prepare for the ubiquitous examination paper.  The content of the book, and the associated exercises, are typically used to support five creative design exercises, the final one being a group project mirroring the activity of a consultancy undertaking a design (not an implementation) for a client. Engagement with the material of this book can have a variety of outcomes. The composer of a school newsletter and the applicant for a multi-million investment should both be able to convey their message more effectively, and the curator of an exhibition will have new presentational techniques on their palette.  For those students training to be visual/interaction designers the exercises have led to original and stimulating outcomes.",

        "description": "Everyday Innovators explores the active role of people, collectively and individually, in shaping the use of information and communication technologies. It examines issues around acquiring and using that knowledge of users, how we should conceptualise the role of users and understand the forms and limitations of their participation. To what extent should we think of users as being innovative and creative? To what extent is this routine or exceptional, confined to particular group of users or part of many people’s experience of technologies? Where does the nature of the ICT or the particularities of its design impose constraints on the active role that users can play in their interaction with devices and services? Where do the horizons and orientations of the users influence or limit what they want and expect of their ICTs and how they use them? This book enables a cross-fertilisation of perspectives from different disciplines and aims to provide new insights into the role of users, drawing out both applied and theoretical implications",

In the last decade, the interest in agile and lean software development has been continuously growing. Agile and lean have evolved from a way of working -- restricted in the beginning to a few early adopters -- to the mainstream way of developing software. All this time, the XP conference series has actively promoted agility and widely disseminated research results in this area. XP 2013 successfully continued this tradition. The 17 full papers accepted for XP 2013 were selected from 52 submissions and are organized in sections on: teaching and learning; development teams; agile practices; experiences and lessons learned; large-scale projects; and architecture and design.",

The necessary theoretical foundations have been laid in the first volume that introduces the theoretical mechanical aspects of mechatronic systems. Here the focus is on the application of the modeling methodology to various examples of rigid-body mechanisms, simple planar ones as well as more challenging spatial problems. A rich variety of joint models, active constraints, plus active and passive force elements is treated. The book is intended for self-study by working engineers and students concerned with the control of mechanical systems, i.e. robotics, mechatronics, vehicles, and machine tools. The examples included are a likely source from which to choose models for university lectures.",

In recent years, it has come to play an ever more important role in the theory of computing. It is studied in many disciplines, including process theory and concurrency, modal logic and automata theory. Typically, coinductive proofs demonstrate the equivalence of two objects by constructing a suitable bisimulation relation between them. This collection of surveys is aimed at both researchers and Master's students in computer science and mathematics and deals with various aspects of bisimulation and coinduction, with an emphasis on process theory. Seven chapters cover the following topics: history, algebra and coalgebra, algorithmics, logic, higher-order languages, enhancements of the bisimulation proof method, and probabilities. Exercises are also included to help the reader master new material'--",

The contributions in this book cover a broad range of topics relevant to the theory and practice of network analysis, including the reliability of complex networks, software, theory, methodology, and applications.  Network analysis has become a major research topic over the last several years. The broad range of applications that can be described and analyzed by means of a network has brought together researchers, practitioners from numerous fields such as operations research, computer science, transportation, energy, biomedicine, computational neuroscience and social sciences. In addition, new approaches and computer environments such as parallel computing, grid computing, cloud computing, and quantum computing have helped to solve large scale network optimization problems.",

        "description": "Recent Advances in Robot Learning contains seven papers on robot learning written by leading researchers in the field. As the selection of papers illustrates, the field of robot learning is both active and diverse. A variety of machine learning methods, ranging from inductive logic programming to reinforcement learning, is being applied to many subproblems in robot perception and control, often with objectives as diverse as parameter calibration and concept formulation. While no unified robot learning framework has yet emerged to cover the variety of problems and approaches described in these papers and other publications, a clear set of shared issues underlies many robot learning problems. Machine learning, when applied to robotics, is situated: it is embedded into a real-world system that tightly integrates perception, decision making and execution. Since robot learning involves decision making, there is an inherent active learning issue. Robotic domains are usually complex, yet the expense of using actual robotic hardware often prohibits the collection of large amounts of training data. Most robotic systems are real-time systems. Decisions must be made within critical or practical time constraints. These characteristics present challenges and constraints to the learning system. Since these characteristics are shared by other important real-world application domains, robotics is a highly attractive area for research on machine learning. On the other hand, machine learning is also highly attractive to robotics. There is a great variety of open problems in robotics that defy a static, hand-coded solution. Recent Advances in Robot Learning is an edited volume of peer-reviewed original research comprising seven invited contributions by leading researchers. This research work has also been published as a special issue of Machine Learning (Volume 23, Numbers 2 and 3).",

        "description": "Computational Electromagnetics is a young and growing discipline, expanding as a result of the steadily increasing demand for software for the design and analysis of electrical devices. This book introduces three of the most popular numerical methods for simulating electromagnetic fields: the finite difference method, the finite element method and the method of moments. In particular it focuses on how these methods are used to obtain valid approximations to the solutions of Maxwell's equations, using, for example, 'staggered grids' and 'edge elements.' The main goal of the book is to make the reader aware of different sources of errors in numerical computations, and also to provide the tools for assessing the accuracy of numerical methods and their solutions. To reach this goal, convergence analysis, extrapolation, von Neumann stability analysis, and dispersion analysis are introduced and used frequently throughout the book. Another major goal of the book is to provide students with enough practical understanding of the methods so they are able to write simple programs on their own. To achieve this, the book contains several MATLAB programs and detailed description of practical issues such as assembly of finite element matrices and handling of unstructured meshes. Finally, the book summarizes  the strengths and weaknessesof the different methods to help the student decide which method may be best for each problem.  In this second edition the book was updated throughout and  extensive computer projects are included.  Reviews of previous edition: 'This well-written monograph is devoted to students at the undergraduate level, but is also useful for practising engineers.' (Zentralblatt MATH, 2007) ",

        "description": "The success of product line engineering techniques in the last 15 years has popularized the use of software variability as a key modeling approach for describing the commonality and variability of systems at all stages of the software lifecycle. Software product lines enable a family of products to share a common core platform, while allowing for product specific functionality being built on top of the platform. Many companies have exploited the concept of software product lines to increase the resources that focus on highly differentiating functionality and thus improve their competitiveness with higher quality and reusable products and decreasing the time-to-market condition. Many books on product line engineering either introduce specific product line techniques or include brief summaries of industrial cases. From these sources, it is difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the various dimensions and aspects of software variability.^ Here the editors address this gap by providing a comprehensive reference on the notion of variability modeling in the context of software product line engineering, presenting an overview of the techniques proposed for variability modeling and giving a detailed perspective on software variability management. Their book is organized in four main parts, which guide the reader through the various aspects and dimensions of software variability. Part 1 which is mostly written by the editors themselves introduces the major topics related to software variability modeling, thus providing a multi-faceted view of both technological and management issues. Next, part 2 of the book comprises four separate chapters dedicated to research and commercial tools. Part 3 then continues with the most practical viewpoint of the book presenting three different industry cases on how variability is managed in real industry projects.^ Finally, part 4 concludes the book and encompasses six different chapters on emerging research topics in software variability like e.g. service-oriented or dynamic software product lines, or variability and aspect orientation. Each chapter briefly summarizes “What you will learn in this chapter”, so both expert and novice readers can easily locate the topics dealt with. Overall, the book captures the current state of the art and best practices, and indicates important open research challenges as well as possible pitfalls. Thus it serves as a reference for researchers and practitioners in software variability management, allowing them to develop the next set of solutions, techniques and methods in this complicated and yet fascinating field of software engineering.",

        "description": "Software effort estimation is a key element of software project planning and management. Yet, in industrial practice, the important role of effort estimation is often underestimated and/or misunderstood. In this book, Adam Trendowicz presents the CoBRA method  (an abbreviation for Cost Estimation, Benchmarking, and Risk Assessment) for estimating the effort required to successfully complete a software development project, which uniquely combines human judgment and measurement data in order to systematically create a custom-specific effort estimation model. CoBRA goes far beyond simply predicting the development effort; it supports project decision-makers in negotiating the project scope, managing project risks, benchmarking productivity, and directing improvement activities. To illustrate the method’s practical use, the book reports several real-world cases where CoBRA was applied in various industrial contexts. These cases represent different estimation contexts in terms of software project environment, estimation objectives, and estimation constraints. This book is the result of a successful collaboration between the process management division of Fraunhofer IESE and many software companies in the field of software engineering technology transfer. It mainly addresses software practitioners who deal with planning and managing software development projects as part of their daily work, and is also of interest for students or courses specializing in software engineering or software project management.",

        "description": "While compilers for high-level programming languages are large complex software systems, they have particular characteristics that differentiate them from other software systems. Their functionality is almost completely well-defined – ideally there exist complete precise descriptions of the source and target languages. Additional descriptions of the interfaces to the operating system, programming system and programming environment, and to other compilers and libraries are often available. This book deals with the analysis phase of translators for programming languages. It describes lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis, specification mechanisms for these tasks from the theory of formal languages, and methods for automatic generation based on the theory of automata. The authors present a conceptual translation structure, i.e., a division into a set of modules, which transform an input program into a sequence of steps in a machine program, and they then describe the interfaces between the modules. Finally, the structures of real translators are outlined. The book contains the necessary theory and advice for implementation. This book is intended for students of computer science. The book is supported throughout with examples, exercises and program fragments.",

        "description": "In 1969 Herbert Simon wrote a book, The Science of the Artificial, in which he argued that cognitive science should have its area of application in the design of devices. He proposed the foundation of a science of the artificial related with cognitive science in the sense in which we have traditionally understood the relationship between the engineering disciplines and the basic sciences. Such a science has been called cognitive ergonomics or cognitive engineering (Norman 1986). Simon’s cognitive ergonomics (1969), would be independent of cognitive science, its basic science, although both would be closely related. Cognitive science would contribute knowledge on human cognitive processes, and cognitive ergonomics would contribute concrete problems of design that should be solved in the context of the creation of devices. Norman (1986), the author that coined the term cognitive engineering, conceived it as an applied cognitive science where the knowledge of cognitive science is combined with that of engineering to solve design problems. According to Norman, its objectives would be: (1) to understand the fundamental principles of human actions important for the development of the engineering of design principles, and (2) to build systems that are pleasant in their use.",

What makes Michio Kaku's vision of the future of science so compelling and authoritative is that it is based on the groundbreaking research already underway at leading laboratories around the world. Weaving interviews with over 150 scientists - several of them Nobel laureates - into a rich, inspiring narrative, Dr. Kaku reveals the growing consensus among key scientists about how science will likely evolve through the early, middle, and late years of the twenty-first century.",

        "description": "The sheer computing power of modern information technology is changing the face of research not just in science, technology and mathematics, but in humanities and cultural studies too. Recent decades have seen a major shift both in attitudes and deployment of computers, which are now vital and highly effective tools in disciplines where they were once viewed as elaborate typewriters. This revealing volume details the vast array of computing applications that researchers in the humanities now have recourse to, including the dissemination of scholarly information through virtual ‘co-laboratories’, data retrieval, and the modeling of complex processes that contribute to our natural and cultural heritage. One key area covered in this book is the versatility of computers in presenting images and graphics, which is transforming the analysis of data sets and archaeological reconstructions alike.  The papers published here are grouped into three broad categories that cover mathematical and computational methods, research developments in information systems, and a detailed portrayal of ongoing work on documenting, restoring and presenting cultural monuments including the temples in Pompeii and the Banteay Chhmar temples of the Angkorian period in present-day Cambodia. Originally presented at a research workshop in Heidelberg, Germany, they reflect the rapidly developing identity of computational humanities as an interdisciplinary field in its own right, as well as demonstrating the breadth of perspectives in this young and vibrant research area.",

        "description": "Computer programs are becoming more and more part of systems that we use to rely on in our daily lives. The proper functioning and safety of these systems is of paramount importance. A major challenger for computer science is to develop methods that ensure program correctness. This textbook provides a structured introduction to program verification using an assertional approach - so named because it relies on the use of assertions that are attached to program control points. Sequential programs in the form of deterministic and nondeterministic programs, and concurrent programs in the form of parallel and distributed programs are considered within the context of their partial and total correctness. The use of these proof systems is demonstrated with the help of case studies. In particular solutions to classical problems such as mutual exclusion are formally verified. Each chapter concludes with exercises and bibliographic remarks for further reading. As a result, this text will be appropriate for either an introductory course on program verification for upper division of undergraduate studies or for graduate studies. It can also be used as an introduction to operational semantics. Outlines of possible courses are presented in the preface of the book.",

The theoretical and computational tools that enable the formulation, solution, and interpretation of nonlinear structures are presented in a systematic fashion so as to gradually attain an increasing level of complexity of structural behaviors, under the prevailing assumptions on the geometry of deformation, the constitutive aspects and the loading scenarios. Readers will find a treatment of the foundations of nonlinear structural mechanics towards advanced reduced models, unified with modern computational tools in the framework of the prominent nonlinear structural dynamic phenomena while tackling both the mathematical and applied sciences. Nonlinear Structural Mechanics: Theory, Dynamical Phenomena and Modelingis an excellent reference for engineers of various disciplines, students, and researchers involved with nonlinear structural mechanics and dynamics.",

        "description": "This monograph gives a comprehensive description of the relationship and connections between kinetic theory and fluid dynamics, mainly for a time-independent problem in a general domain. Ambiguities in this relationship are clarified, and the incompleteness of classical fluid dynamics in describing the behavior of a gas in the continuum limit—recently reported as the ghost effect—is also discussed. The approach used in this work engages an audience of theoretical physicists, applied mathematicians, and engineers. By a systematic asymptotic analysis, fluid-dynamic-type equations and their associated boundary conditions that take into account the weak effect of gas rarefaction are derived from the Boltzmann system. Comprehensive information on the Knudsen-layer correction is also obtained. Equations and boundary conditions are carefully classified depending on the physical context of problems. Applications are presented to various physically interesting phenomena, including flows induced by temperature fields, evaporation and condensation problems, examples of the ghost effect, and bifurcation of flows. Kinetic Theory and Fluid Dynamics serves as a bridge for those working in different communities where kinetic theory is important: graduate students, researchers and practitioners in theoretical physics, applied mathematics, and various branches of engineering.",

        "description": "Since the first edition of this book in 1981, Prolog has continued to attract an unexpectedly great deal of interest in the computer science community and has turned out to be a basis for an important new family of programming languages and systems for Artificial Intelligence. In the preceding three editions, the authors have steadily added new material, improved the presentation, and corrected various minor errors to provide a textbook as well as a reference work for everyone who wants to study and use Prolog as a practical programming language. The authors concentrate on teaching 'core' Prolog. All examples conform to this standard and will run on the most widely-used Prolog implementations some of which are listed in the appendices with indications as to how they diverge from the standard.",

These include fields as diverse as biology, medicine, chemistry, environmental physics, image processing and computer vision. The material chosen was presented at a multidisciplinary workshop on parameter estimation held in 2009 in Heidelberg. The contributions show how indispensable efficient methods of applied mathematics and computer-based modeling can be to enhancing the quality of interdisciplinary research. The use of scientific computing to model, simulate, and optimize complex processes has become a standard methodology in many scientific fields, as well as in industry. Demonstrating that the use of state-of-the-art optimization techniques in a number of research areas has much potential for improvement, this book provides advanced numerical methods and the very latest results for the applications under consideration.",

The authors explain in particular how to design Web Dynpro components, the data binding and interface methods, and the view controller methods. They also describe the other SAP NetWeaver Elements (ABAP Dictionary, Authorization) and the integration of the Web Dynpro Application into the SAP NetWeaver Portal. The new edition has been expanded to include chapters on subjects such as POWER Lists; creating the Modal Windows and External Windows; using Web Dynpro application parameters and Shared Objects to communicate between the Web Dynpro ABAP Application and Business Server Pages; and creating multi-language mails using Web Dynpro ABAP.",

        "description": "'An important topic, which is on the boundary between numerical analysis and computer science…. I found the book well written and containing much interesting material, most of the time disseminated in specialized papers published in specialized journals difficult to find. Moreover, there are very few books on these topics and they are not recent.' –Numerical Algorithms (review of the first edition) This unique book provides concepts and background necessary to understand and build algorithms for computing the elementary functions—sine, cosine, tangent, exponentials, and logarithms. The author presents and structures the algorithms, hardware-oriented as well as software-oriented, and also discusses issues related to accurate floating-point implementation. The purpose is not to give 'cookbook recipes' that allow one to implement a given function, but rather to provide the reader with tools necessary to build or adapt algorithms for their specific computing environment. This expanded second edition contains a number of revisions and additions, which incorporate numerous new results obtained during the last few years. New algorithms invented since 1997—such as Matula’s bipartite method, another table-based method due to Ercegovac, Lang, Tisserand, and Muller—as well as new chapters on multiple-precision arithmetic and examples of implementation have been added. In addition, the section on correct rounding of elementary functions has been fully reworked, also in the context of new results. Finally, the introductory presentation of floating-point arithmetic has been expanded, with more emphasis given to the use of the fused multiply-accumulate instruction. The book is an up-to-date presentation of information needed to understand and accurately use mathematical functions and algorithms in computational work and design. Graduate and advanced undergraduate students, professionals, and researchers in scientific computing, numerical analysis, software engineering, and computer engineering will find the book a useful reference and resource.",

Anhand vieler Beispiele wird die Lösung spezieller Detailprobleme mit grundlegendem Charakter gezeigt. Die durch die Optimierung von Geschäftsprozessen entstandenen neuen Herausforderungen bezüglich der Simulation bilden einen Schwerpunkt der Darstellung, ein separater Teil ist den theoretischen Grundlagen gewidmet. Lernziel des Buches ist die Fähigkeit, diskrete Prozesse mit den passenden Mitteln zu modellieren und dazu eine Simulationssoftware zu entwerfen bzw. die Mechanismen bestehender Simulationssoftware so zu begreifen, dass sie gewinnbringend eingesetzt werden kann. Die wichtigen Programmstrukturen sind in Form von Pseudocode dargestellt und dadurch völlig unabhängig von einer Programmiersprache oder Spezialsoftware. Damit ist das Buch für eine breite Leserschaft geeignet.",

In this book a complete account of image structure is proposed in terms of rigorously defined machine concepts, using basic tools from algebra, analysis, and differential geometry. Machine technicalities such as discretisation and quantisation details are de-emphasised, and robustness with respect to noise is manifest. From the foreword by Jan Koenderink: `It is my hope that the book will find a wide audience, including physicists - who still are largely unaware of the general importance and power of scale space theory, mathematicians - who will find in it a principled and formally tight exposition of a topic awaiting further development, and computer scientists - who will find here a unified and conceptually well founded framework for many apparently unrelated and largely historically motivated methods they already know and love. The book is suited for self-study and graduate courses, the carefully formulated exercises are designed to get to grips with the subject matter and prepare the reader for original research.'",

The 15 full papers presented together with 2 invited papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 22 submissions. The goals were on one side to bind mathematical domains such as algebraic topology or algebraic geometry to AI but also to link AI to domains outside pure algorithmic computing. The papers address all current aspects in the area of symbolic computing and AI: basic concepts of computability and new Turing machines; logics including non-classical ones; reasoning; learning; decision support systems; and machine intelligence and epistemology and philosophy of symbolic mathematical computing.",

Firstly, it shows engineers why it is useful to deal with, for example, Hilbert spaces, imbedding theorems, weak convergence, monotone operators, compact sets, when solving real-life technical problems. Secondly, mathematicians will see the importance and necessity of dealing with material anisotropy, inhomogeneity, nonlinearity and complicated geometrical configurations of electrical devices, which are not encountered when solving academic examples with the Laplace operator on square or ball domains. Mathematical and numerical analysis of several important technical problems arising in electrical engineering are offered, such as computation of magnetic and electric field, nonlinear heat conduction and heat radiation, semiconductor equations, Maxwell equations and optimal shape design of electrical devices. The reader is assumed to be familiar with linear algebra, real analysis and basic numerical methods. Audience: This volume will be of interest to mathematicians and engineers whose work involves numerical analysis, partial differential equations, mathematical modelling and industrial mathematics, or functional analysis.",

Owning the most powerful computer, the latest high-tech gadget, and the whizziest website is a status symbol on a par with having a flashy car or a designer suit. And a media obsessed with the digital explosion has reappropriated the term 'computer nerd' so that it's practically synonymous with 'entrepreneur.' Yet, a mere fifteen years ago, wireheads hooked on tweaking endless lines of code were seen as marginal weirdos, outsiders whose world would never resonate with the mainstream. That was before one pioneering work documented the underground computer revolution that was about to change our world forever. With groundbreaking profiles of Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club, and more, Steven Levy's Hackers brilliantly captures a seminal moment when the risk takers and explorers were poised to conquer twentieth-century America's last great frontier. And in the Internet age, 'the hacker ethic' -- first espoused here -- is alive and well. - Back cover.",

Each topic is clearly explained and illustrated by detailed worked examples, with a focus on algorithms rather than mathematical formalism. It is written for readers without a strong background in mathematics or statistics, and any formulae used are explained in detail.This second edition has been expanded to include additional chapters on using frequent pattern trees for Association Rule Mining, comparing classifiers, ensemble classification and dealing with very large volumes of data.Principles of Data Mining aims to help general readers develop the necessary understanding of what is inside the 'black box' so they can use commercial data mining packages discriminatingly, as well as enabling advanced readers or academic researchers to understand or contribute to future technical advances in the field.Suitable as a textbook to support courses at undergraduate or postgraduate levels in a wide range of subjects including Computer Science, Business Studies, Marketing, Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics and Forensic Science.",

        "description": "Multi-Agent Programming is an essential reference for anyone interested in the most up-to-date developments in MAS programming. Programmers, researchers, and graduate students will find this text unique in its presentation of the concepts and principles of this fast-growing field. While previous research has focused on the development of formal and informal approaches to analyse and specify Multi-Agent Systems, this book focuses on the development of programming languages and tools which not only support MAS programming, but also implement key concepts of MAS in unified frameworks. Part I describes four approaches that are based on computational logic or process algebra--Jason, 3APL, IMPACT, and CLAIM/SyMPA. These programming languages have formal semantics and use heavy machinery based on formal methods, but also provide working platforms for the development of multi-agent systems. Part II presents agent languages and platforms that extend or are based on Java--JADE, Jadex, and JACKTM. Although these have no formal semantics, the languages are well documented and the platforms provide a variety of tools that have been extensively used in practice. Part III provides two significant industry specific applications--The DEFACTO System for coordinating human-agent teams for the future of disaster response, and the ARTIMIS rational dialogue agent technology. The book also features seven appendices, summarising each of the agent programming languages, hence facilitating comparison of the approaches. In particular, Appendix A describes the criteria used for comparing the agent languages and platforms.",

        "description": "Although they are believed to be unsolvable in general, tractability results suggest that some practical NP-hard problems can be efficiently solved. Combinatorial search algorithms are designed to efficiently explore the usually large solution space of these instances by reducing the search space to feasible regions and using heuristics to efficiently explore these regions. Various mathematical formalisms may be used to express and tackle combinatorial problems, among them the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT). These algorithms, or constraint solvers, apply search space reduction through inference techniques, use activity-based heuristics to guide exploration, diversify the searches through frequent restarts, and often learn from their mistakes. In this book the author focuses on knowledge sharing in combinatorial search, the capacity to generate and exploit meaningful information, such as redundant constraints, heuristic hints, and performance measures, during search, which can dramatically improve the performance of a constraint solver. Information can be shared between multiple constraint solvers simultaneously working on the same instance, or information can help achieve good performance while solving a large set of related instances. In the first case, information sharing has to be performed at the expense of the underlying search effort, since a solver has to stop its main effort to prepare and communicate the information to other solvers; on the other hand, not sharing information can incur a cost for the whole system, with solvers potentially exploring unfeasible spaces discovered by other solvers. In the second case, sharing performance measures can be done with little overhead, and the goal is to be able to tune a constraint solver in relation to the characteristics of a new instance – this corresponds to the selection of the most suitable algorithm for solving a given instance. The book is suitable for researchers, practitioners, and graduate students working in the areas of optimization, search, constraints, and computational complexity.",

An understanding of these limits prevents the search for non-existing efficient algorithms. This textbook considers randomization as a key concept and emphasizes the interplay between theory and practice: New branches of complexity theory continue to arise in response to new algorithmic concepts, and its results - such as the theory of NP-completeness - have influenced the development of all areas of computer science. The topics selected have implications for concrete applications, and the significance of complexity theory for today's computer science is stressed throughout.",

It collects the basic mathematical ideas and tools needed as a basis for more serious studies or even independent research in statistics. The majority of existing textbooks in mathematical statistics follow the classical asymptotic framework. Yet, as modern statistics has changed rapidly in recent years, new methods and approaches have appeared. The emphasis is on finite sample behavior, large parameter dimensions, and model misspecifications. The present book provides a fully self-contained introduction to the world of modern mathematical statistics, collecting the basic knowledge, concepts and findings needed for doing further research in the modern theoretical and applied statistics. This textbook is primarily intended for graduate and postdoc students and young researchers who are interested in modern statistical methods.",

        "description": "From the reviews of the previous editions '.... The book is a first class textbook and seems to be indispensable for everybody who has to teach combinatorial optimization. It is very helpful for students, teachers, and researchers in this area. The author finds a striking synthesis of nice and interesting mathematical results and practical applications. ... the author pays much attention to the inclusion of well-chosen exercises. The reader does not remain helpless; solutions or at least hints are given in the appendix. Except for some small basic mathematical and algorithmic knowledge the book is self-contained. ...' K.Engel, Mathematical Reviews 2002 The substantial development effort of this text, involving multiple editions and trailing in the context of various workshops, university courses and seminar series, clearly shows through in this new edition with its clear writing, good organisation, comprehensive coverage of essential theory, and well-chosen applications. The proofs of important results and the representation of key algorithms in a Pascal-like notation allow this book to be used in a high-level undergraduate or low-level graduate course on graph theory, combinatorial optimization or computer science algorithms. The well-worked solutions to exercises are a real bonus for self study by students. The book is highly recommended. P .B. Gibbons, Zentralblatt für Mathematik 2005 Once again, the new edition has been thoroughly revised. In particular, some further material has been added: more on NP-completeness (especially on dominating sets), a section on the Gallai-Edmonds structure theory for matchings, and about a dozen additional exercises – as always, with solutions. Moreover, the section on the 1-factor theorem has been completely rewritten: it now presents a short direct proof for the more general Berge-Tutte formula. Several recent research developments are discussed and quite a few references have been added.",

Initially launched in 1989, for all these years the conference has provided a broad forum for researchers working in the area of Information Systems Engineering. To reflect on the work done so far and to examine prospects for future work, the CAiSE Steering Committee decided to present a selection of seminal papers published for the conference during these years and to ask their authors, all prominent researchers in the field, to comment on their work and how it has developed over the years. The scope of the papers selected covers a broad range of topics related to modeling and designing information systems, collecting and managing requirements, and with special attention to how information systems are engineered towards their final development and deployment as software components. With this approach, the book provides not only a historical analysis on how information systems engineering evolved over the years, but also a fascinating social network analysis of the research community. Additionally, many inspiring ideas for future research and new perspectives in this area are sparked by the intriguing comments of the renowned authors.",

Starting from abstract ideas and formulations, and culminating in detailed algorithms, Optimized Bayesian Dynamic Advising comprises a unified treatment of an important problem of the design of advisory systems supporting supervisors of complex processes. It introduces the theoretical and algorithmic basis of developed advising, relying on novel and powerful combination black-box modeling by dynamic mixture models and fully probabilistic dynamic optimization. The proposed non-standard problem formulation and its solution mark a significant contribution to the design of anthropocentric automation systems. Written for a broad audience, including developers of algorithms and application engineers, researchers, lecturers and postgraduates, this book can be used as a reference tool, and an advanced text on Bayesian dynamic decision making.",

        "description": "With the development of ever more powerful computers a new branch of physics and engineering evolved over the last few decades: Computer Simulation or Computational Physics. It serves two main purposes: - Solution of complex mathematical problems such as, differential equations, minimization/optimization, or high-dimensional sums/integrals. - Direct simulation of physical processes, as for instance, molecular dynamics or Monte-Carlo simulation of physical/chemical/technical processes. Consequently, the book is divided into two main parts: Deterministic methods and stochastic methods. Based on concrete problems, the first part discusses numerical differentiation and integration, and the treatment of ordinary differential equations. This is augmented by notes on the numerics of partial differential equations. The second part discusses the generation of random numbers, summarizes the basics of stochastics which is then followed by the introduction of various Monte-Carlo (MC) methods. Specific emphasis is on MARKOV chain MC algorithms. All this is again augmented by numerous applications from physics. The final two chapters on Data Analysis and Stochastic Optimization share the two main topics as a common denominator. The book offers a number of appendices to provide the reader with more detailed information on various topics discussed in the main part. Nevertheless, the reader should be familiar with the most important concepts of statistics and probability theory albeit two appendices have been dedicated to provide a rudimentary discussion.",

        "description": "Optimization problems subject to constraints governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are among the most challenging problems in the context of industrial, economical and medical applications. Almost the entire range of problems in this field of research was studied and further explored as part of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) priority program 1253 on “Optimization with Partial Differential Equations” from 2006 to 2013. The investigations were motivated by the fascinating potential applications and challenging mathematical problems that arise in the field of PDE constrained optimization. New analytic and algorithmic paradigms have been developed, implemented and validated in the context of real-world applications. In this special volume, contributions from more than fifteen German universities combine the results of this interdisciplinary program with a focus on applied mathematics.   The book is divided into five sections on “Constrained Optimization, Identification and Control”, “Shape and Topology Optimization”, “Adaptivity and Model Reduction”, “Discretization: Concepts and Analysis” and “Applications”. Peer-reviewed research articles present the most recent results in the field of PDE constrained optimization and control problems. Informative survey articles give an overview of topics that set sustainable trends for future research. This makes this special volume interesting not only for mathematicians, but also for engineers and for natural and medical scientists working on processes that can be modeled by PDEs.",

The text is self-contained by including a chapter on the necessary mathematical background, chapters on the formal ridge definitions in any geometric setting, and a chapter on the numerical implementation. An applications chapter covers three separate topics: medical image analysis, molecular modeling, and analysis of fluid flow. Audience: The book is intended primarily for computer vision and image processing scientists with a background in mathematics and scientific computation. However, ridges provide a general purpose tool for multidimensional data analysis, so the book will be of interest to practitioners in any field which requires the analyzing of data, such as statistics, the physical sciences, or engineering.",

        "description": "Mobile devices allow users to access information resources and services over many different distribution channels – anywhere, anytime, anyhow. Technical and usage characteristics of mobile systems are highly variable with respect to user capabilities and context characteristics, therefore an immense level of flexibility is required. Barbara Pernici - with contributions by the research groups involved in the project - presents here a framework for mobile information systems, focussing on quality of service and adaptability at all architectural levels, ranging from adaptive applications to e-services, middleware, and infrastructural elements, as it was developed in the 'Multichannel Adaptive Information Systems (MAIS)' project. The design models, methods, and tools developed in the project allow the realization of adaptive mobile information systems in a variety of different architectures. The book is divided into three parts: core technologies for mobile information systems (e.g., adaptive middleware and flexible e-services), enabling technologies (like data management on small devices or adaptive low-power hardware architectures or wireless networks), and methodological aspects of mobile information systems design (such as service profiling or user interface and e-service design for context-aware applications). It provides researchers in academia and industry with a comprehensive vision on innovative aspects which can be used as a basis for the development of new frameworks and applications.",

        "description": "Distributed computing is at the heart of many applications. It arises as soon as one has to solve a problem in terms of entities -- such as processes, peers, processors, nodes, or agents --^ that individually have only a partial knowledge of the many input parameters associated with the problem. In particular each entity cooperating towards the common goal cannot have an instantaneous knowledge of the current state of the other entities. Whereas parallel computing is mainly concerned with 'efficiency', and real-time computing is mainly concerned with 'on-time computing', distributed computing is mainly concerned with 'mastering uncertainty' created by issues such as the multiplicity of control flows, asynchronous communication, unstable behaviors, mobility, and dynamicity.   While some distributed algorithms consist of a few lines only, their behavior can be difficult to understand and their properties hard to state and prove. The aim of this book is to present in a comprehensive way the basic notions, concepts, and algorithms of distributed computing when the distributed entities cooperate by sending and receiving messages on top of an asynchronous network.^ The book is composed of seventeen chapters structured into six parts: distributed graph algorithms, in particular what makes them different from sequential or parallel algorithms; logical time and global states, the core of the book; mutual exclusion and resource allocation; high-level communication abstractions; distributed detection of properties; and distributed shared memory. The author establishes clear objectives per chapter and the content is supported throughout with illustrative examples, summaries, exercises, and annotated bibliographies.   This book constitutes an introduction to distributed computing and is suitable for advanced undergraduate students or graduate students in computer science and computer engineering, graduate students in mathematics interested in distributed computing, and practitioners and engineers involved in the design and implementation of distributed applications. The reader should have a basic knowledge of algorithms and operating systems.",

This book provides a comprehensive account of how CAN (controller area network) can be designed and applied in a wide variety of industrial settings. It covers thoroughly: CAN chip implementations, CAN chip programming, CAN hardware design, CAN system testing and wiring, and CAN applications. The author is a widely recognized expert in this technology with extensive experience in these techniques with companies ranging from Intel, Motorola, and IBM through to Volkswagen and Bosch. He brings to bear his expertise by providing examples of industrial networks from industries such as textiles, elevators, milling machines, excavators, and dental chairs. Beginning with the basic theory of industrial control systems, the book provides simple examples of networked systems. Then stepwise, readers are shown how to apply CAN systems and how to test them. As a result, electronic engineers working with industrial control systems will find this an important book to own.",

These data are processed for the automated detection and tracking of people, vehicles, and other objects. The goal is to locate moving targets, to understand their behavior, and to detect suspicious or abnormal activities for crime prevention. Despite its benefits, there is societal apprehension regarding the use of such technology, so an important challenge in this research area is to balance public safety and privacy. This edited book presents recent findings in the field of intelligent multimedia surveillance emerging from disciplines such as multimedia computing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. It consists of nine chapters addressing intelligent video surveillance, video analysis of crowds, privacy issues in intelligent multimedia surveillance, RFID technology for localization of objects, object tracking using visual saliency information, estimating multiresolution depth using active stereo vision, and performance evaluation for video surveillance systems. The book will be of value to researchers and practitioners working on related problems in security, multimedia, and artificial intelligence.",

        "description": "'During the last decades Computational Intelligence has emerged and showed its contributions in various broad research communities (computer science, engineering, finance, economic, decision making, etc.). This was done by proposing approaches and algorithms based either on turnkey techniques belonging to the large panoply of solutions offered by computational intelligence such as data mining, genetic algorithms, bio-inspired methods, Bayesian networks, machine learning, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, etc. or inspired by computational intelligence techniques to develop new ad-hoc algorithms for the problem under consideration.   This volume is a comprehensive collection of extended contributions from the 4th International Conference on Computer Science and Its Applications (CIIA’2013) organized into four main tracks: Track 1: Computational Intelligence, Track  2: Security & Network Technologies, Track  3: Information Technology and Track 4: Computer Systems and Applications. This book presents recent advances in the use and exploitation of computational intelligence in several real world hard problems covering these tracks such as image processing, Arab text processing, sensor and mobile networks, physical design of advanced databases, model matching, etc. that require advanced approaches and algorithms borrowed from computational intelligence for solving them.",

A solution must be a tree, which is called a Steiner Minimal Tree (SMT), and may contain vertices different from the points which are to be connected. Steiner's Problem is one of the most famous combinatorial-geometrical problems, but unfortunately it is very difficult in terms of combinatorial structure as well as computational complexity. However, if only a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) without additional vertices in the interconnecting network is sought, then it is simple to solve. So it is of interest to know what the error is if an MST is constructed instead of an SMT. The worst case for this ratio running over all finite sets is called the Steiner ratio of the space. The book concentrates on investigating the Steiner ratio. The goal is to determine, or at least estimate, the Steiner ratio for many different metric spaces. The author shows that the description of the Steiner ratio contains many questions from geometry, optimization, and graph theory. Audience: Researchers in network design, applied optimization, and design of algorithms.",

The tools need manual intervention by the programmer to parallelize the code. Programming a parallel computer requires closely studying the target algorithm or application, more so than in the traditional sequential programming we have all learned. The programmer must be aware of the communication and data dependencies of the algorithm or application.

        "description": "The book aims at future teachers of mathematics. All too often the geometry which goes into the syllabus for teacher-students presents the material as pedantic and formalistic, suppressing its dynamic character and its role as part of the foundation for our common cultural heritage. The motivation for the book is to open up these aspects of the field. Another motivation is to provide an invitation to mathematics in general. It is an unfortunate fact that today, at a time when mathematics and knowledge of mathematics are more important than ever, phrases like math avoidance and math anxiety are very much in the public vocabulary. An important task is seriously attempting to heal these ills. Ills perhaps inflicted on students at an early age, through deficient or even harmful teaching practices. Thus the book also aims at an informed public, interested in making a new beginning in math. And in doing so, learning more about this part of our cultural heritage. The book is divided into two parts. Part 1 is called A Cultural Heritage. The section constitutes an excursion into the history of geometry. It also contains material which is normally not included into a mathematical text. For example, we relate some of the stories told by the Greek historian, Herodotus. Apart from being good reading, some of the early geometers were very much part of these events.",

        "description": "Following hot on the heels of The Imitation Game, this is the first modern biography of Alan Turing by a member of the family—Alan’s nephew, Sir Dermot Turing. Alan Turing was an extraordinary man who crammed into a life of only 42 years the careers of mathematician, codebreaker, computer scientist, and biologist. He is widely regarded as a war hero grossly mistreated by his unappreciative country and it has become hard to disentangle the real man from the story. It is easy to cast him as a misfit, the stereotypical professor. But actually Alan Turing was never a professor, and his nickname 'Prof' was given by his codebreaking friends at Bletchley Park. Now, Alan Turing’s nephew, Dermot Turing, has taken a fresh look at the influences on Alan Turing’s life and creativity, and the later creation of a legend. Dermot’s vibrant and entertaining approach to the life and work of a true genius makes this a fascinating read. This unique family perspective features insights from secret documents only recently released to the UK National Archives and other sources not tapped by previous biographers, looks into the truth behind Alan’s conviction for gross indecency, and includes previously unpublished photographs from the Turing family album.",

        "description": "Algorithms for intelligent fault diagnosis of automated operations offer significant benefits to the manufacturing and process industries. Furthermore, machine learning methods enable such monitoring systems to handle nonlinearities and large volumes of data. This unique text/reference describes in detail the latest advances in Unsupervised Process Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis with Machine Learning Methods. Abundant case studies throughout the text demonstrate the efficacy of each method in real-world settings. The broad coverage examines such cutting-edge topics as the use of information theory to enhance unsupervised learning in tree-based methods, the extension of kernel methods to multiple kernel learning for feature extraction from data, and the incremental training of multilayer perceptrons to construct deep architectures for enhanced data projections. Topics and features: Reviews the application of machine learning to process monitoring and fault diagnosis Discusses machine learning frameworks based on artificial neural networks, statistical learning theory and kernel-based methods, and tree-based methods Examines the application of machine learning to steady state and dynamic operations, with a focus on unsupervised learning Describes the use of spectral methods in process fault diagnosis This highly practical and clearly-structured work is an invaluable resource for all researchers and practitioners involved in process control, multivariate statistics and machine learning.

        "description": "Conformal prediction is a valuable new method of machine learning. Conformal predictors are among the most accurate methods of machine learning, and unlike other state-of-the-art methods, they provide information about their own accuracy and reliability. This new monograph integrates mathematical theory and revealing experimental work. It demonstrates mathematically the validity of the reliability claimed by conformal predictors when they are applied to independent and identically distributed data, and it confirms experimentally that the accuracy is sufficient for many practical problems. Later chapters generalize these results to models called repetitive structures, which originate in the algorithmic theory of randomness and statistical physics. The approach is flexible enough to incorporate most existing methods of machine learning, including newer methods such as boosting and support vector machines and older methods such as nearest neighbors and the bootstrap. Topics and Features: * Describes how conformal predictors yield accurate and reliable predictions, complemented with quantitative measures of their accuracy and reliability * Handles both classification and regression problems * Explains how to apply the new algorithms to real-world data sets * Demonstrates the infeasibility of some standard prediction tasks * Explains connections with Kolmogorov’s algorithmic randomness, recent work in machine learning, and older work in statistics * Develops new methods of probability forecasting and shows how to use them for prediction in causal networks Researchers in computer science, statistics, and artificial intelligence will find the book an authoritative and rigorous treatment of some of the most promising new developments in machine learning. Practitioners and students in all areas of research that use quantitative prediction or machine learning will learn about important new methods.",

        "description": "The ICANNGA series of Conferences has been organised since 1993 and has a long history of promoting the principles and understanding of computational intelligence paradigms within the scientific community and is a reference for established workers in this area. Starting in Innsbruck, in Austria (1993), then to Ales in Prance (1995), Norwich in England (1997), Portoroz in Slovenia (1999), Prague in the Czech Republic (2001) and finally Roanne, in France (2003), the ICANNGA series has established itself for experienced workers in the field. The series has also been of value to young researchers wishing both to extend their knowledge and experience and also to meet internationally renowned experts. The 2005 Conference, the seventh in the ICANNGA series, will take place at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, drawing on the experience of previous events, and following the same general model, combining technical sessions, including plenary lectures by renowned scientists, with tutorials.",

Very quickly I learned that the best way to respond to such remarks was a series of counter questions about what exactly is computer science and why. The difficulties that many brilliant people had responding those questions led me to suspect that there's something deeper about that topic, yet the more I read about it, the more confused I got. Over the years I've heard the same reason--'That's not computer science'--used to turn down tenure, to reject doctoral theses, and to decline funding. Eventually I became convinced that the nature of computing as a discipline is something worth studying and writing about. Fortunate enough, the word 'no' does not belong to the vocabulary of professor Erkki Sutinen, who became my supervisor, academic mentor, colleague, and friend. Throughout my studies in his group I worked on a broad variety of applied computing topics, ranging from unconventional to eccentric, yet in the meanwhile Erkki encouraged me to continue to study computing's disciplinary identity, and I ended up writing, in a great rush, a thesis on the topic. When my curiosity took me from the University of Eastern Finland to Asia and then to Africa for the better half of a decade, I kept on writing small practice essays on computing's identity'--",

        "description": "Android development is hot, and many programmers are interested in joining the fun. However, because this technology is based on Java, you should first obtain a solid grasp of the Java language and its foundational APIs to improve your chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. After all, you will be busy learning the architecture of an Android app, the various Android-specific APIs, and Android-specific tools. If you do not already know Java fundamentals, you will probably end up with a massive headache from also having to quickly cram those fundamentals into your knowledge base.  Learn Java for Android Development, Second Edition teaches programmers of any skill level the essential Java language and foundational Java API skills that must be learned to improve the programmer’s chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. Each of the book’s 14 chapters provides an exercise section that gives you the opportunity to reinforce your understanding of the chapter’s material. Answers to the book’s more than 500 exercises are provided in an appendix. A second appendix provides a significant game-oriented Java application, which you can convert into an Android app. Once you complete this book, you should be ready to dive into beginning Android app development.  Maybe, start that journey with Apress' Beginning Android.",

        "description": "This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed conference proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Biomedical Simulation (ISBMS) which was held in Strasbourg, France, in October 2014. Biomedical modeling and simulation are at the center stage of worldwide efforts to understand and replicate the behavior and function of the human organism. Large scale initiatives such as the Physiome Project, Virtual Physiological Human and Blue Brain Project aim to develop advanced computational models that will facilitate the understanding of the integrative function of cells, organs, and organisms, with the ultimate goal of delivering truly personalized medicine. At the same time, progress in modeling, numerical techniques and haptics has enabled more complex and interactive simulations. The 27 revised full papers (including 16 regular and 11 short papers) were carefully selected from 45 submissions and cover topics such as training systems and haptics, physics-based registration, vascular modeling and simulation, image and simulation, modeling, surgical planning, analysis, characterization and validation.",

This has lead to a much larger scale of applicability and mining of sensor data sets. The human-centric aspect of sensor data has created tremendous opportunities in integrating social aspects of sensor data collection into the mining process. Managing and Mining Sensor Datais a contributed volume by prominent leaders in this field, targeting advanced-level students in computer science as a secondary text book or reference.

The subject of the book is computer integrated manufacturing. The purpose is to bring together decision support, artificial intelligence, knowledge based and fuzzy systems and integrate them into advanced manufacturing technologies, production planning, flexible and programmable systems of the future. European and Japanese perspectives lay the ground works for the current practices from the perspective of industry and research. The challenges are: management decision support systems; artificial intelligence and knowledge based systems. Management of uncertainties is dealt with as frontier treatment of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logics. Various models of manufacturing technology related operation research models attempt to bring answers to problems of flexibility and integration, shape modelling and automated inspection. Only four articles deal with current status. In the remaining seventeen articles, the reader will find results associated with current research that attempts to find answers to challenging problems forecasted to be in the factories of the future.",

        "description": "Our cyber defenses are static and are governed by lengthy processes, e.g., for testing and security patch deployment.  Adversaries could plan their attacks carefully over time and launch attacks at cyber speeds at any given moment.  We need a new class of defensive strategies that would force adversaries to continually engage in reconnaissance and re-planning of their cyber operations.  One such strategy is to present adversaries with a moving target where the attack surface of a system keeps changing. Moving Target Defense II: Application of Game Theory and Adversarial Modeling includes contributions from world experts in the cyber security field.  In the first volume of MTD, we presented MTD approaches based on software transformations, and MTD approaches based on network and software stack configurations. In this second volume of MTD, a group of leading researchers describe game theoretic, cyber maneuver, and software transformation approaches for constructing and analyzing MTD systems. Designed as a professional book for practitioners and researchers working in the cyber security field, advanced -level students and researchers focused on computer science will also find this book valuable as a secondary text book or reference.",

        "description": "This book provides an original graph theoretical approach to the fundamental properties of wireless mobile ad-hoc networks. This approach is combined with a realistic radio model for physical links between nodes to produce new insights into network characteristics like connectivity, degree distribution, hopcount, interference and capacity. This book clearly demonstrates how the Medium Access Control protocols impose a limit on the level of interference in ad-hoc networks. It has been shown that interference is upper bounded, and a new accurate method for the estimation of interference power statistics in ad-hoc and sensor networks is introduced here. Furthermore, this volume shows how multi-hop traffic affects the capacity of the network. In multi-hop and ad-hoc networks there is a trade-off between the network size and the maximum input bit rate possible per node. Large ad-hoc or sensor networks, consisting of thousands of nodes, can only support low bit-rate applications. This work provides valuable directives for designing ad-hoc networks and sensor networks. It will not only be of interest to the academic community, but also to the engineers who roll out ad-hoc and sensor networks in practice.",

They are so much more sure than I am about eve- thing.” John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) The world’s ?rst photograph was taken by Joseph Nicephore Ni´ epce (1775–1833) in 1826 on his country estate near Chalon-sur-Saˆ one, France. The photo shows parts of farm buildings and some sky. Exposure time was eight hours. Ni´ epce used a pinhole camera, known as camera obscura, and utilized pewter plates as the support medium for the photographic process. The camera obscura, the basic projection model of pinhole cameras, was ?rst reported by the Chinese philosopher Mo-Ti (5th century BC): light rayspassingthroughapinholeintoadarkenedroomcreateanupside-down image of the outside world.

        "description": "A decision procedure is an algorithm that, given a decision problem, terminates with a correct yes/no answer. Here, the authors focus on theories that are expressive enough to model real problems, but are still decidable. Specifically, the book concentrates on decision procedures for first-order theories that are commonly used in automated verification and reasoning, theorem-proving, compiler optimization and operations research. The techniques described in the book draw from fields such as graph theory and logic, and are routinely used in industry. The authors introduce the basic terminology of satisfiability modulo theories and then, in separate chapters, study decision procedures for each of the following theories: propositional logic; equalities and uninterpreted functions; linear arithmetic; bit vectors; arrays; pointer logic; and quantified formulas. They also study the problem of deciding combined theories and dedicate a chapter to modern techniques based on an interplay between a SAT solver and a decision procedure for the investigated theory. This textbook has been used to teach undergraduate and graduate courses at ETH Zurich, at the Technion, Haifa, and at the University of Oxford. Each chapter includes a detailed bibliography and exercises. Lecturers' slides and a C++ library for rapid prototyping of decision procedures are available from the authors' website.

It is structured into different chapters, written by outstanding experts in the field. Many fundamental issues are considered, such as: the mathematical representation of vascular geometries extracted from medical images, modelling blood rheology and the complex multilayer structure of the vascular tissue, and its possible pathologies, the mechanical and chemical interaction between blood and vascular walls, and the different scales coupling local and systemic dynamics. All of these topics introduce challenging mathematical and numerical problems, demanding for advanced analysis and efficient simulation techniques, and pay constant attention to applications of relevant clinical interest. This book is addressed to graduate students and researchers in the field of bioengineering, applied mathematics and medicine, wishing to engage themselves in the fascinating task of modeling the cardiovascular system or, more broadly, physiological flows.",

Because of the catalyzing nature of internet technology, ITeS today has become more than “Outsourcing” of services.  This book illustrates the enabling nature of ITeS with its entailment of IT, thus contributing to the betterment of humanity.  The scope of this book is not only for academia but also for business persons, government practitioners and readers from daily lives.  Authors from a variety of nations and regions with various backgrounds provide insightful theories, research, findings and practices in various fields such as commerce, finance, medical services, government and education.

It defines the ability of a computing system to perform properly in the presence of various kinds of disturbances and to recover from any service degradation. These properties are immensely important in a world where many aspects of our daily life depend on the correct, reliable and secure operation of often large-scale distributed computing systems. Wolter and her co-editors grouped the 20 chapters from leading researchers into seven parts: an introduction and motivating examples, modeling techniques, model-driven prediction, measurement and metrics, testing techniques, case studies, and conclusions. The core is formed by 12 technical papers, which are framed by motivating real-world examples and case studies, thus illustrating the necessity and the application of the presented methods. While the technical chapters are independent of each other and can be read in any order, the reader will benefit more from the case studies if he or she reads them together with the related techniques.",

Molecular primitives and circuitry for information processing devices are also discussed. Investigations in molecular based computing devices were initiated in the early 1970s in the hopes for an increase in the integration level and processing speed. Real progress proved unfeasible into the 1980´s. However, recently, important and promising results were achieved. The elaboration of operational 160-kilobit molecular electronic memory patterned 1011 bits per square centimeter in the end of 90´s were the first timid steps of information processing further development. Subsequent advances beyond these developments are presented and discussed. This work provides useful knowledge to anyone working in molecular based information processing.",

        "description": "The framework of algorithms presented in this book is called Cost Approximation. It describes, for a given formulation of a variational inequality or nonlinear programming problem, an algorithm by means of approximating mappings and problems, a principle for the updating of the iteration points, and a merit function which guides and monitors the convergence of the algorithm. One purpose of the book is to offer this framework as an intuitively appealing tool for describing an algorithm. Another purpose is to provide a convergence analysis of the algorithms in the framework. Audience: The book will be of interest to all researchers in the field (it includes over 800 references) and can also be used for advanced courses in non-linear optimization with the possibility of being oriented either to algorithm theory or to the numerical aspects of large-scale nonlinear optimization.",

The scope of the conference targeted the identification, analysis, and description of the dynamics of logistic processes and networks. The spectrum ranged from the modeling and planning of processes and innovative methods like autonomous control and knowledge management to the new technologies provided by radio frequency identification, mobile communication, and networking. The growing dynamics in the area of logistics poses completely new challenges: Logistic processes and networks must rapidly and flexibly adapt to continuously changing conditions. LDIC 2012 provided a venue for researchers from academia and industry interested in the technical advances in dynamics in logistics. The conference addressed research in logistics from a wide range of fields, e.g. engineering, computer science and operations research. The volume consists of two invited papers and of 49 contributed papers divided into various subjects including transport logistics, routing in dynamic logistic networks, modeling, simulation, optimization and collaboration in logistics, identification technologies, mathematical modeling in transport and production logistics, information, communication, risk and failure in logistic systems, autonomous control in logistic processes, global supply chains and industrial applications, and the Internet of Things in the context of logistics.",

        "description": "The Encyclopedia of Social Network Analysis and Mining (ESNAM) is the first major reference work to integrate fundamental concepts and research directions in the areas of social networks and  applications to data mining. While ESNAM  reflects the state-of-the-art in  social network research, the field  had its start in the 1930s when fundamental issues in social network research were broadly defined. These communities were limited to relatively small numbers of nodes (actors) and links. More recently the advent of electronic communication, and in particular on-line communities, have created social networks of hitherto unimaginable sizes. People around the world are directly or indirectly connected by popular social networks established using web-based platforms rather than by physical proximity. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of this unique field, the essential contributions of diverse disciplines, from computer science, mathematics, and statistics to sociology and behavioral science, are described among the 300 authoritative yet highly readable entries. Students will find a world of information and insight behind the familiar façade of the social networks in which they participate. Researchers and practitioners will benefit from a comprehensive perspective on the methodologies for analysis of constructed networks, and the data mining and machine learning techniques that have proved attractive for sophisticated knowledge discovery in complex applications. Also addressed is the application of social network methodologies to other domains, such as web networks and biological networks.",

        "description": "Ist die Mathematik frei von Widersprüchen? Gibt es Wahrheiten jenseits des Beweisbaren? Ist es möglich, unser mathematisches Wissen in eine einzige Zahl hineinzucodieren? Die moderne mathematische Logik des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts gibt verblüffende Antworten auf solche Fragen; Antworten, die die Mathematik in der gleichen Weise verändert haben wie die Einstein'sche Relativitätstheorie die Physik. Heute wissen wir, dass in der Mathematik erkenntnistheoretische Grenzen existieren, die wir nicht überwinden können. Sie sind integraler Bestandteil jener Gesetzmäßigkeiten, die diese Wissenschaft im Innersten zusammenhalten. Das vorliegende Buch entführt Sie auf eine Reise durch die Kerngebiete der mathematischen Logik, hin zu den Grenzen der Mathematik. Unter anderem werden die folgenden Themen behandelt: Geschichte der mathematischen Logik, formale Systeme, axiomatische Zahlentheorie und Mengenlehre, Beweistheorie, die Gödel'schen Unvollständigkeitssätze, Berechenbarkeitstheorie, algorithmische Informationstheorie, Modelltheorie. Das Buch enthält zahlreiche zweifarbige Abbildungen und mehr als 70 Aufgaben (mit Lösungen auf der Website zum Buch). Für die zweite Auflage wurde das Kapitel 'Beweistheorie' thematisch um das Diagonalisierungslemma, den Satz von Tarski, das Berry-Paradoxon sowie den Satz von Löb erweitert. Stimmen zur ersten Auflage: 'Der Schreibstil des Autors - stets auf Verständlichkeit bedacht - die vielen historischen Bezüge, die wohldurchdachte Aufmachung des Buches mit seinen vielen Bildern, Beispielen und Merkkästen und nicht zuletzt die jedem Kapitel beigegebenen Aufgaben machen das Buch zu einer Perle.' Mathematische Semesterberichte 'Ein lang ersehntes Buch' 'Spannender kann man ein Sachbuch nicht schreiben.' 'Definitives Muss.' Aus verschiedenen Leserrezensionen auf amazon.de",

        "description": "Embedded systems have long become essential in application areas in which human control is impossible or infeasible. The development of modern embedded systems is becoming increasingly difficult and challenging because of their overall system complexity, their tighter and cross-functional integration, the increasing requirements concerning safety and real-time behavior, and the need to reduce development and operation costs. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the Software Platform Embedded Systems (SPES) modeling framework and demonstrates its applicability in embedded system development in various industry domains such as automation, automotive, avionics, energy, and healthcare. In SPES 2020, twenty-one partners from academia and industry have joined forces in order to develop and evaluate in different industrial domains a modeling framework that reflects the current state of the art in embedded systems engineering.The content of this book is structured in four parts. Part I “Starting Point” discusses the status quo of embedded systems development and model-based engineering, and summarizes the key requirements faced when developing embedded systems in different application domains. Part II “The SPES Modeling Framework” describes the SPES modeling framework. Part III “Application and Evaluation of the SPES Modeling Framework” reports on the validation steps taken to ensure that the framework met the requirements discussed in Part I. Finally, Part IV “Impact of the SPES Modeling Framework” summarizes the results achieved and provides an outlook on future work.The book is mainly aimed at professionals and practitioners who deal with the development of embedded systems on a daily basis. Researchers in academia and industry may use it as a compendium for the requirements and state-of-the-art solution concepts for embedded systems development.

The aim is to present the complex methodology in  an easily understandable but mathematically correct fashion. The approach of  one-dimensional elements enables the reader to focus on the understanding of  the principles of basic and advanced mechanical problems. The reader easily  understands the assumptions and limitations of mechanical modeling as well  as the underlying physics without struggling with complex mathematics. But  although the description is easy it remains scientifically correct. The approach using only one-dimensional elements covers not only standard  problems but allows also for advanced topics like plasticity or the  mechanics of composite materials. Many examples illustrate the concepts and  problems at the end of every chapter help to familiarize with the topics. ",

        "description": "In order to exchange knowledge, humans need to share a common lexicon of words as well as to access the world models underlying that lexicon. What is a natural process for a human turns out to be an extremely hard task for a machine: computers can’t represent knowledge as effectively as humans do, which hampers, for example, meaning disambiguation and communication. Applied ontologies and NLP have been developed to face these challenges. Integrating ontologies with (possibly multilingual) lexical resources is an essential requirement to make human language understandable by machines, and also to enable interoperability and computability across information systems and, ultimately, in the Web. This book explores recent advances in the integration of ontologies and lexical resources, including questions such as building the required infrastructure (e.g., the Semantic Web) and different formalisms, methods and platforms for eliciting, analyzing and encoding knowledge contents (e.g., multimedia, emotions, events, etc.).  The contributors look towards next-generation technologies, shifting the focus from the state of the art to the future of Ontologies and Lexical Resources.  This work will be of interest to research scientists, graduate students, and professionals in the fields of knowledge engineering, computational linguistics, and semantic technologies. ",

For many researchers working in this field in ma- thematics and physics, computer algebra software systems have become indispensable tools in theory and applications. This edited survey book consists of 20 chapters showing application of Clifford algebra in quantum mechanics, field theory, spinor calculations, projective geometry, Hypercomplex algebra, function theory and crystallography. Many examples of computations performed with a variety of readily available software programs are presented in detail, i.e., Maple, Mathematica, Axiom, etc. A key feature of the book is that it shows how scientific knowledge can advance with the use of computational tools and software.",

        "description": "Decision Theory = Probability + Utility Theory + + Universal Induction = Ockham + Bayes + Turing = = A Unified View of Artificial Intelligence This book presents sequential decision theory from a novel algorithmic information theory perspective. While the former is suited for active agents in known environments, the latter is suited for passive prediction in unknown environments. The book introduces these two well-known but very different ideas and removes the limitations by unifying them to one parameter-free theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded in an arbitrary unknown environment. Most if not all AI problems can easily be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes include sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations to other approaches to AI. One intention of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about abstract algorithmic information theory concepts, and conversely to inform theorists about exciting applications to AI.",

Each chapter begins by introducing a problem and then guiding the student through its solution. The computational techniques needed to solve the problem are developed as necassary, making the motivation for learning the computing alwasy apparent. Each chapter will introduce a single problem that will be used to motivate a single computing concept. The notes currently consist of 15 chapters. The first seven chapters deal with Maple and the last eight with C. The textbook will contain 20 to 30 chapters covering a similar mix of concepts at a finer level of detail.",

The topics covered by the papers of the SARS and the MLSC workshop demonstrate the breadth and the richness of the respective fields of the two workshops stretching from robot programming to languages and compilation techniques, to real-time and fault tolerance, to dependability, software architectures, computer vision, cognitive robotics, multi-robot-coordination, and simulation to bio-inspired algorithms, and from machine learning for anomaly detection, to model construction in software product lines to classification of web service interfaces. In addition the SARS workshop hosted a special session on the recently launched KOROS project on collaborating robot systems that is borne by a consortium of researchers of the faculties of architecture and planning, computer science, electrical engineering and information technology, and mechanical and industrial engineering at the Vienna University of Technology. The four papers devoted to this session highlight important research directions pursued in this interdisciplinary research project.",

        "description": "Due to the rapid growth of digital communication and electronic data exchange, information security has become a crucial issue in industry, business, and administration. Modern cryptography provides essential techniques for securing information and protecting data. In the first part, this book covers the key concepts of cryptography on an undergraduate level, from encryption and digital signatures to cryptographic protocols. Essential techniques are demonstrated in protocols for key exchange, user identification, electronic elections and digital cash. In the second part, more advanced topics are addressed, such as the bit security of one-way functions and computationally perfect pseudorandom bit generators. The security of cryptographic schemes is a central topic. Typical examples of provably secure encryption and signature schemes and their security proofs are given. Though particular attention is given to the mathematical foundations, no special background in mathematics is presumed. The necessary algebra, number theory and probability theory are included in the appendix. Each chapter closes with a collection of exercises. The second edition contains corrections, revisions and new material, including a complete description of the AES, an extended section on cryptographic hash functions, a new section on random oracle proofs, and a new section on public-key encryption schemes that are provably secure against adaptively-chosen-ciphertext attacks.",

        "description": "Information retrieval, IR, the science of extracting information from any potential source, can be viewed in a number of ways: logical, probabilistic and vector space models are some of the most important. In this book, the author, one of the leading researchers in the area, shows how these views can be reforged in the same framework used to formulate the general principles of quantum mechanics. All the usual quantum-mechanical notions have their IR-theoretic analogues, and the standard results can be applied to address problems in IR, such as pseudo-relevance feedback, relevance feedback and ostensive retrieval. The relation with quantum computing is also examined. To keep the book self-contained appendices with background material on physics and mathematics are included. Each chapter ends with bibliographic remarks that point to further reading. This is an important, ground-breaking book, with much new material, for all those working in IR, AI and natural language processing.",

This book uses the R statistical package which contains an extensive library of functions.  The R software is free and easily downloaded and installed.  The R programs are run in the R Studio software which is a graphical user interface for Windows.\nThe R Studio software makes accessing R programs, viewing output from the exercises, and graphical displays easier to manage.  The first chapter of the book covers the fundamentals of the R statistical package.  This includes installation of R and R Studio, accessing R packages and libraries of functions.  The chapter also covers how to access manuals and technical documentation, as well as, basic R commands used in the R script programs in the chapters.  This chapter is important for the instructor to master so that the software can be installed and the R script programs run.  The R software is free so students can also install the software and run the R script programs in the chapters.   Teachers and students can run the R software on university computers, at home, or on laptop computers making it more available than many commercial software packages.  'As a professor who teaches research methods and advises master and doctoral students, I am often seeking practical resource materials that students can use in their research.  This book provides easy to run R examples that allow students to pick and choose content that is relevant to their research.\nWhen students learn that the cost for running R is free, they are especially happy!'  - Kim Nimon, University of North Texas  'The authors have done a great job of providing resource materials an instructor can use when teaching a statistics course.  Strengths of the book are the inclusion of R code, the addition of more than 60 script programs, and the online exercise materials for students.  This book reflects the growing use of the mobile R software program for students who may not always have access to other statistical software packages housed on computers in a campus-based lab.' - David Walker, Northern Illinois University",

The method of DRE is a technique for changing a higher dimensional integration to a lower dimensional one with or without remainder. To date, there is no comprehensive treatment of this subject in monograph or textbook form. Key features of this self-contained monograph include: * fine exposition covering the history of the subject * up-to-date new results, related to many fields of current research such as boundary element methods for solving PDEs and wavelet analysis * presentation of DRE techniques using a broad array of examples * good balance between theory and application * coverage of such related topics as boundary type quadratures and asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals * excellent and comprehensive bibliography and index This work will appeal to a broad audience of students and researchers in pure and applied mathematics, statistics, and physics, and can be used in a graduate/advanced undergraduate course or as a standard reference text.",

This reader-friendly textbook/reference is the first work of its kind to provide a comprehensive and unified Introduction to Computational Social Science. Four distinct methodological approaches are examined in particular detail, namely automated social information extraction, social network analysis, social complexity theory, and social simulation modeling. The coverage of each of these approaches is supported by a discussion of the historical context and motivations, as well as by a list of recommended texts for further reading. Topics and features: Describes the scope and content of each area of CSS, covering topics on information extraction, social networks, complexity theory, and social simulations Highlights the main theories of the CSS paradigm as causal explanatory frameworks that shed new light on the nature of human and social dynamics Explains how to distinguish and analyze the different levels of analysis of social complexity using computational approaches Discusses a number of methodological tools, including extracting entities from text, computing social network indices, and building an agent-based model Presents the main classes of entities, objects, and relations common to the computational analysis of social complexity Examines the interdisciplinary integration of knowledge in the context of social phenomena This unique, clearly-written textbook is essential reading for graduate and advanced undergraduate students planning on embarking on a course on computational social science, or wishing to refresh their knowledge of the fundamental aspects of this exciting field.",

        "description": "Activities performed in organizations are coordinated according to organizational goals via communication between the people involved. In all known languages the sentences used to communicate  are naturally  structured by subject, verb, and object. The subject  describes the actor, the verb the action and the object what is affected by the action.  Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) as presented in this book is based on this simple structure which enables  process-oriented thinking  and process modeling. S-BPM puts the subject of a process at the center of attention and thus deals with business processes and their organizational environment from a new perspective, meeting organizational requirements in a much better way than traditional approaches. Subjects represent agents of an action in a process,  which can be either technical or human (e.g. a thread in an IT system or a clerk).^\nA process structures the actions of each subject and coordinates the required communication among the subjects. S-BPM provides a coherent procedural framework to model an organization’s business processes: its focus is the cooperation of all stakeholders involved in the strategic, tactical, and operational issues, sharing their knowledge in a networked structure. Based on findings of developmental psychology and linguistics, the authors show that natural sentence semantics have to be used for complete S-BPM specifications. In this way, business process owners are able to ensure that business requirements of internal and external stakeholders are easily understood and met in their entirety. Starting with process analysis and then going through the whole modeling lifecycle, they demonstrate how subject orientation can develop and be experienced by gradually focusing on communication for service provision.^\nIn addition, they illustrate how each modeling activity can be supported through the use of appropriate software tools. The authors’ presentation style focuses on professionals in the industry, and on students specializing in process management or organizational modeling.  Each chapter begins with a summary of key findings and is full of examples, hints, and possible pitfalls. An interpreter model, a toolbox, and a glossary summarizing the main terms complete the book. The web site www.i2pm.net provides additional software tools and further material.",

        "description": "This book is an introductory text on design science, intended to support both graduate students and researchers in structuring, undertaking and presenting design science work. It builds on established design science methods as well as recent work on presenting design science studies and ethical principles for design science, and also offers novel instruments for visualizing the results, both in the form of process diagrams and through a canvas format. While the book does not presume any prior knowledge of design science, it provides readers with a thorough understanding of the subject and enables them to delve into much deeper detail, thanks to extensive sections on further reading. Design science in information systems and technology aims to create novel artifacts in the form of models, methods, and systems that support people in developing, using and maintaining IT solutions. This work focuses on design science as applied to information systems and technology, but it also includes examples from, and perspectives of, other fields of human practice. Chapter 1 provides an overview of design science and outlines its ties with empirical research. Chapter 2 discusses the various types and forms of knowledge that can be used and produced by design science research, while Chapter 3 presents a brief overview of common empirical research strategies and methods. Chapter 4 introduces a methodological framework for supporting researchers in doing design science research as well as in presenting their results. This framework includes five core activities, which are described in detail in Chapters 5 to 9. Chapter 10 discusses how to communicate design science results, while Chapter 11 compares the proposed methodological framework with methods for systems development and shows how they can be combined. Chapter 12 discusses how design science relates to research paradigms, in particular to positivism and interpretivism. Lastly, Chapter 13 discusses ethical issues and principles for design science research.",

Readers will learn how to build models of programs and, more generally, discrete systems, but this is all done with practice in mind. The numerous examples provided arise from various sources of computer system developments, including sequential programs, concurrent programs, and electronic circuits. The book also contains a large number of exercises and projects ranging in difficulty. Each of the examples included in the book has been proved using the Rodin Platform tool set, which is available free for download at www.event-b.org'--Provided by publisher.",

        "description": "Social systems are among the most complex known. This poses particular problems for those who wish to understand them. The complexity often makes analytic approaches infeasible and natural language approaches inadequate for relating intricate cause and effect. However, individual- and agent-based computational approaches hold out the possibility of new and deeper understanding of such systems.  Simulating Social Complexity examines all aspects of using agent- or individual-based simulation. This approach represents systems as individual elements having each their own set of differing states and internal processes. The interactions between elements in the simulation represent interactions in the target systems. What makes these elements 'social' is that they are usefully interpretable as interacting elements of an observed society.^ In this, the focus is on human society, but can be extended to include social animals or artificial agents where such work enhances our understanding of human society.  The phenomena of interest then result (emerge) from the dynamics of the interaction of social actors in an essential way and are usually not easily simplifiable by, for example, considering only representative actors.  The introduction of accessible agent-based modelling allows the representation of social complexity in a more natural and direct manner than previous techniques. In particular, it is no longer necessary to distort a model with the introduction of overly strong assumptions simply in order to obtain analytic tractability. This makes agent-based modelling relatively accessible to a range of scientists. The outcomes of such models can be displayed and animated in ways that also make them more interpretable by experts and stakeholders.^ This handbook is intended to help in the process of maturation of this new field. It brings together, through the collaborative effort of many leading researchers, summaries of the best thinking and practice in this area and constitutes a reference point for standards against which future methodological advances are judged. This book will help those entering into the field to avoid 'reinventing the wheel' each time, but it will also help those already in the field by providing accessible overviews of current thought. The material is divided into four sections: Introductory, Methodology, Mechanisms, and Applications. Each chapter starts with a very brief section called ‘Why read this chapter?’ followed by an abstract, which summarizes the content of the chapter. Each chapter also ends with a section of ‘Further Reading’ briefly describing three to eight items that a newcomer might read next.",

It firstly introduces standard methods and discusses the typical Intelligent Audio Analysis chain going from audio data to audio features to audio recognition.  Further, an introduction to audio source separation, and enhancement and robustness are given. After the introductory parts, the book shows several applications for the three types of audio: speech, music, and general sound. Each task is shortly introduced, followed by a description of the specific data and methods applied, experiments and results, and a conclusion for this specific task. The books provides benchmark results and standardized test-beds for a broader range of audio analysis tasks. The main focus thereby lies on the parallel advancement of realism in audio analysis, as too often today’s results are overly optimistic owing to idealized testing conditions, and it serves to stimulate synergies arising from transfer of methods and leads to a holistic audio analysis.",

The adoption of Off-The-Shelf (OTS) items plays a key role in such a scenario. OTS items allow mastering complexity and reducing costs and time-to-market; however, achieving these goals by ensuring dependability requirements at the same time is challenging. CRITICAL STEP project establishes a strategic collaboration between academic and industrial partners, and proposes a framework to support the development of dependable, OTS-based, critical systems. The book introduces methods and tools adopted by the critical systems industry, and surveys key achievements of the CRITICAL STEP project along four directions: fault injection tools, V&V of critical systems, runtime monitoring and evaluation techniques, and security assessment.",

The book places special emphasis upon system-level co-synthesis techniques for architectures that contain voltage scalable processors, which can dynamically trade off between computational performance and power consumption. Throughout the book, the introduced co-synthesis techniques, which target both single-mode systems and emerging multi-mode applications, are applied to numerous benchmarks and real-life examples including a realistic smart phone.",

        "description": "This book is a rigorous introduction to classical and nonclassical logics which emphasizes deduction as a form of computation. It can be used to teach classical, modal, and intuitistic predicate logic. It also presents the logical and mathematical foundations for resolution theorem proving and Logic Programming. A distinctive feature of this book is its uniform mathematical treatment of logic, based on the tableau method of classical logic, which includes soundness, completeness, compactness, incompleteness, and the theorems of Herb Rand and Skolem-L Wenheim. The same uniform treatment is used for important areas of application in computer science and artificial intelligence. These include resolution theorem proving, Logic Programming and Prolog, Predicate Intuitionistic Logic, and Predicate Modal Logic. There is also an historical appendix and an extensive list of selected references so that both the background and more advanced developments of these subjects can be understood and pursued. This text is appropriate for upper level undergraduate and beginning graduate students.",

        "description": "Genetic algorithms are founded upon the principle of evolution, i.e., survival of the fittest. Hence evolution programming techniques, based on genetic algorithms, are applicable to many hard optimization problems, such as optimization of functions with linear and nonlinear constraints, the traveling salesman problem, and problems of scheduling, partitioning, and control. The importance of these techniques has been growing in the last decade, since evolution programs are parallel in nature, and parallelism is one of the most promising directions in computer science. The book is self-contained and the only prerequisite is basic undergraduate mathematics. It is aimed at researchers, practitioners, and graduate students in computer science and artificial intelligence, operations research, and engineering. This second edition includes several new sections and many references to recent developments. A simple example of genetic code and an index are also added. Writing an evolution program for a given problem should be an enjoyable experience - this book may serve as a guide to this task.",

The book contains seventeen chapters, each dealing with one area of photographic science, and a final chapter containing exercises. Each chapter, except the two introductory chapters and the last one, begins with general background information at a level understandable by graduate and undergraduate students. It then proceeds to develop a mathematical model, using mathematical tools such as ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and stochastic processes. Next, some mathematical results are mentioned, often providing a partial solution to problems raised by the model. Finally, most chapters include open problems. The last chapter of the book contains 'Modeling and Applied Mathematics' exercises based on the material presented in the earlier chapters.These exercises are intended primarily for graduate students and advanced undergraduates.",

        "description": "This book introduces nonlinear control systems at a level suitable for graduate students and researchers. Chapter 1 introduces invariant distributions, a fundamental tool in the analysis of the internal structure of nonlinear systems. It is shown that a nonlinear system locally exhibits decompositions into parts similar to those introduced by Kalman for linear systems. Chapter 2 explains to what extent global decompositions may exist, corresponding to a partition of the whole state space into lower dimensional subsets. Chapter 3 describes various formats in which the input-output map of a nonlinear system may be represented, and provides a short description of the fundamentals of realization theory. Chapter 4 illustrates how a series of relevant design problems can be solved for a single-input single-output nonlinear system. It explains how a system can be transformed into a linear and controllable one, discusses the role of the nonlinear analogue of the notion of 'zero', and describes the problem of asymptotic tracking, model matching and disturbance decoupling. Chapter 5 covers similar subjects for those multivariable nonlinear systems which can be rendered noninteractive by means of static state feedback, and Chapters 6 and 7 are devoted to control via dynamic feedback for a broader class of multivariable nonlinear systems. The book was first published in 1985 as Volume 72 in the series Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences. The new edition has been thoroughly revised and furnished with examples and exercises at the end of each chapter.",

        "description": "Key to our culture is that we can disseminate information, and then maintain and access it over time. While we are rapidly advancing from vulnerable physical solutions to superior, digital media, preserving and using data over the long term involves complicated research challenges and organization efforts. Uwe Borghoff and his coauthors address the problem of storing, reading, and using digital data for periods longer than 50 years. They briefly describe several markup and document description languages like TIFF, PDF, HTML, and XML, explain the most important techniques such as migration and emulation, and present the OAIS (Open Archival Information System) Reference Model. To complement this background information on the technology issues the authors present the most relevant international preservation projects, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, and experiences from sample projects run by the Cornell University Library and the National Library of the Netherlands. A rated survey list of available systems and tools completes the book. With this broad overview, the authors address librarians who preserve our digital heritage, computer scientists who develop technologies that access data, and information managers engaged with the social and methodological requirements of long-term information access.",

With a wealth of cutting-edge research in the field, Integral Methods in Science and Engineering: Progress in Numerical and Analytic Techniques provides a detailed portrait of both the construction of theoretical integral techniques and their application to specific problems in science and engineering.   The chapters in this volume are based on talks given by well-known researchers at the Twelfth International Conference on Integral Methods in Science and Engineering, July 23–27, 2012, in Porto Alegre, Brazil. They address a broad range of topics, from problems of existence and uniqueness for singular integral equations on domain boundaries to numerical integration via finite and boundary elements, conservation laws, hybrid methods, and other quadrature-related approaches.  The contributing authors bring their expertise to bear on a number of topical problems that have to date resisted solution, thereby offering help and guidance to fellow professionals worldwide.                                                                                             Integral Methods in Science and Engineering: Progress in Numerical and Analytic Techniques will be a valuable resource for researchers in applied mathematics, physics, and mechanical and electrical engineering, for graduate students in these disciplines, and for various other professionals who use integration as an essential tool in their work.",

This introductory book emphasises algorithms and applications, such as cryptography and error correcting codes, and is accessible to a broad audience. The mathematical prerequisites are minimal: nothing beyond material in a typical undergraduate course in calculus is presumed, other than some experience in doing proofs - everything else is developed from scratch. Thus the book can serve several purposes. It can be used as a reference and for self-study by readers who want to learn the mathematical foundations of modern cryptography. It is also ideal as a textbook for introductory courses in number theory and algebra, especially those geared towards computer science students.",

        "description": "Summary:This book reports on a novel and comprehensive approach to the uptake of ICT in Schools. It focuses on key questions, pedagogically sound ways of introducing ICT, new technical artifacts supporting the approach, the evaluation in a large-scale validator, and future work. While many innovations in Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) have emerged over the last two decades, the uptake of these innovations has not always been very successful, particularly in schools. The transition from proof of concept to integration into learning activities has been recognized as a bottleneck for quite some time. This major problem, which is affecting many TEL stakeholders, is the focus of this book which focuses on developing a more effective and efficient approach based on more than 2500 pilots in European classrooms. Teachers, head teachers, and policy makers may benefit from reading how novel learning scenarios can be elaborated, adapted to a local context, and implemented in the classroom; how new technologies can support this process for teachers and their national/regional communities; how teachers and other stakeholders can be educated in such a re-engineering process; how the approach can be scaled up through MOOCs, ambassador schemes, and train-the-trainer programs; how future classroom labs can inspire teachers, head teachers, and policy makers; how teachers and, above all, learners can become more engaged in learning through the adoption of the iTEC approach. Readers with a more technical focus may also be interested in the discussion of recommender systems, the flexible provision of resources and services, the deployment of the cloud in schools, and systems for composing technological support for lesson plans",

        "description": "The purpose of this book is to provide an up-to-date introduction to the time-domain finite element methods for Maxwell’s equations involving metamaterials. Since the first successful construction of a metamaterial with both negative permittivity and permeability in 2000, the study of metamaterials has attracted significant attention from researchers across many disciplines. Thanks to enormous efforts on the part of engineers and physicists, metamaterials present great potential applications in antenna and radar design, sub-wavelength imaging, and invisibility cloak design. Hence the efficient simulation of electromagnetic phenomena in metamaterials has become a very important issue and is the subject of this book, in which various metamaterial modeling equations are introduced and justified mathematically. The development and practical implementation of edge finite element methods for metamaterial Maxwell’s equations are the main focus of the book. The book finishes with some interesting simulations such as backward wave propagation and time-domain cloaking with metamaterials.",

They are behavior conventions that describe how com­munication systems inter­act with each other, defining the temporal order of the interactions and the formats of the data units exchanged – essentially they determine the efficiency and reliability of computer networks.Protocol Engineeringis an important discipline covering the design, validation, and implementation of communication protocols. Part I of this book is devoted to the fundamentals of communication protocols, describing their working principles and implicitly also those of computer networks. The author introduces the concepts of service, protocol, layer, and layered architecture, and introduces the main elements required in the description of protocols using a model language. He then presents the most important protocol functions.^\nPart II deals with the description of communication proto­cols, offering an overview of the various formal methods, the essence ofProtocol Engineering. The author introduces the fundamental description methods, such as finite state machines, Petri nets, process calculi, and temporal logics, that are in part used as semantic models for formal description techniques. He then introduces one represen­tative technique for each of the main description approaches, among others SDL and LOTOS, and surveys the use of UML for describing protocols. Part III covers the protocol life cycle and the most important development stages, presenting the reader with approaches for systematic protocol design, with various verification methods, with the main implementation techniques, and with strategies for their testing, in particular with conformance and interoperability tests, and the test description language TTCN.^\nThe author uses the simple data transfer example protocol XDT (eXample Data Transfer) throughout the book as a reference protocol to exemplify the various description techniques and to demonstrate important validation and implementation approaches.The book is an introduction to communication protocols and their development for undergraduate and graduate students of computer science and communication technology, and it is also a suitable reference for engineers and programmers. Most chapters contain exercises, and the author's accompanying website provides further online material including a complete formal description of the XDT protocol and an animated simulation visualizing its behavior.

        "description": "Business Process Management (BPM) is the art and science of how work should be performed in an organization in order to ensure consistent outputs and to take advantage of improvement opportunities, e.g. reducing costs, execution times or error rates. Importantly, BPM is not about improving the way individual activities are performed, but rather about managing entire chains of events, activities and decisions that ultimately produce added value for an organization and its customers.This textbook encompasses the entire BPM lifecycle, from process identification to process monitoring, covering along the way process modelling, analysis, redesign and automation. Concepts, methods and tools from business management, computer science and industrial engineering are blended into one comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach. The presentation is illustrated using the BPMN industry standard defined by the Object Management Group and widely endorsed by practitioners and vendors worldwide.   In addition to explaining the relevant conceptual background, the book provides dozens of examples, more than 100 hands-on exercises – many with solutions – as well as numerous suggestions for further reading. The textbook is the result of many years of combined teaching experience of the authors, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as in the context of professional training. Students and professionals from both business management and computer science will benefit from the step-by-step style of the textbook and its focus on fundamental concepts and proven methods. Lecturers will appreciate the class-tested format and the additional teaching material available on the accompanying website.",

It describes an approach based on techniques from software engineering called aspect-oriented programming, which allow designers to control today’s sophisticated design tool chains, while maintaining a single application source code.  Readers are introduced to the basic concepts of an aspect-oriented, domain specific language that enables control of a wide range of compilation and synthesis tools in the partitioning and mapping of an application to a heterogeneous (and possibly multi-core) target architecture.  Several examples are presented that illustrate the benefits of the approach developed for applications from avionics and digital signal processing. Using the aspect-oriented programming techniques presented in this book, developers can reuse extensive sections of their designs, while preserving the original application source-code, thus promoting developer productivity as well as architecture and performance portability.   ·         Describes an aspect-oriented approach for the compilation and synthesis of applications targeting heterogeneous embedded computing architectures; ·         Includes examples using an integrated tool chain for compilation and synthesis; ·         Provides validation and evaluation for targeted reconfigurable heterogeneous architectures; ·         Enables design portability, given changing target devices; ·         Allows developers to maintain a single application source code when targeting  multiple architectures.",

        "description": "This is an examination of the history and the state of the art of the quest for visualizing scientific knowledge and the dynamics of its development. Through an interdisciplinary perspective this book presents profound visions, pivotal advances, and insightful contributions made by generations of researchers and professionals, which portrays a holistic view of the underlying principles and mechanisms of the development of science. This updated and extended second edition: highlights the latest advances in mapping scientific frontiers examines the foundations of strategies, principles, and design patterns provides an integrated and holistic account of major developments across disciplinary boundaries “Anyone who tries to follow the exponential growth of the literature on citation analysis and scientometrics knows how difficult it is to keep pace. Chaomei Chen has identified the significant methods and applications in visual graphics and made them clear to the uninitiated. Derek Price would have loved this book which not only pays homage to him but also to the key players in information science and a wide variety of others in the sociology and history of science.” – Eugene Garfield “This is a wide ranging book on information visualization, with a specific focus on science mapping. Science mapping is still in its infancy and many intellectual challenges remain to be investigated and many of which are outlined in the final chapter. In this new edition Chaomei Chen has provided an essential text, useful both as a primer for new entrants and as a comprehensive overview of recent developments for the seasoned practitioner.” – Henry Small Chaomei Chen is a Professor in the College of Information Science and Technology at Drexel University, Philadelphia, USA, and a ChangJiang Scholar at Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China. He is the Editor-in-Chief of Information Visualization and the author of Turning Points: The Nature of Creativity (Springer, 2012) and Information Visualization: Beyond the Horizon (Springer, 2004, 2006).",

Since 1995 this subject is part of the Master’s degree of the course Business Management and Information Technology. Over a decade of teaching, this bookdevelopedinto what it istoday. The book gives an idea of how organizations should organize their - formationandcommunicationtechnologyfacilitiesinordertobeabletosay“IT does not matter.” Management and the organization of IT are only conveniences within day-to-day operations and enablers, for organizations that want to supply other products and services. The book has the following starting points: (a) The IT support of products and services of organizations makes fu- tional and performance demandsontheIT facilities. In order to beable tomeettheserequirementsoptimally,anITarchitectureisrequired.The IT services and products are supplied within this architecture. (b) Controlling IT is part of normal operational management. This means that: –at setting up the IT facilities the principles of logistics and operations management apply; –the information, neededfor controlling a process, makes demandson the set-up of the information service process. The question is: –whether someone is authorized to supplythe data; –whether the data correspondswith thephysically present objects and –whether the given data is correct and complete. (c) A distinction is made between both the IT demand and the IT supply organization. Both organizations have to be set up. Methods indicate, xi xii Preface which processes have to be in place in these organizations and each of these processes has ?nancial, personnel, legal and security aspects.",

In education, traditionally, complicated problems were avoided, since the amount of work for obtaining the solutions was not feasible for the students. This situation has changed now, and the students can be taught real-life problems that they can actually solve using the new powerful software. The reader will improve his knowledge through learning by examples and he will learn how both systems, MATLAB and MAPLE, may be used to solve problems interactively in an elegant way. Readers will learn to solve similar problems by understanding and applying the techniques presented in the book. All programs used in the book are available to the reader in electronic form.",

It is the basis for Objective-C used in programming for the iPhone, the iPad, and other Apple devices. It is the basis for the C++ that is widely used in a great many contexts, including the GNU Project. It underlies the Linux operating system and many of its utilities. Learning C provides a strong foundation for any programming care, and will even help you better understand more modern languages such as Java. Beginning C is written by renowned author Ivor Horton. The book increases your programming expertise by guiding you through the development of fully working C applications that use what you've learned in a practical context. You’ll also be able to strike out on your own by trying the exercises included at the end of each chapter. At the end of the book you'll be confident in your skills with all facets of the widely-used and powerful C language. The only beginning-level book to cover the latest ANSI standard in C Revised to cover C99 features newly-supported by language compilers Emphasizes writing code after the first chapter Includes substantial examples relevant to intermediate users",

        "description": "The emergence of more affordable EEG equipment is fostering a renaissance of approaches to making music with brain signals. This Guide to Brain-Computer Music Interfacing (BCMI) presents a world-class collection of BCMI tools with which adventurous explorers may pursue practical and propositional models in music neurotechnology. The text focuses on how these tools enable the extraction of meaningful control information from brain signals, and discusses how to design effective generative music techniques that respond to this information. Topics and features: Reviews important techniques for hands-free interaction with computers, including event-related potentials with P300 waves Explores questions of semiotic brain-computer interfacing (BCI), and the use of machine learning to dig into relationships among music and emotions Offers tutorials on signal extraction, brain electric fields, passive BCI, and applications for genetic algorithms, along with historical surveys Describes how BCMI research advocates the importance of better scientific understanding of the brain for its potential impact on musical creativity Presents broad coverage of this emerging, interdisciplinary area, from hard-core EEG analysis to practical musical applications This unique and pioneering text/reference will appeal to researchers, graduates and advanced undergraduates from a range of different domains within computer science and beyond, such as music technology and biomedical engineering. Prof. Eduardo R. Miranda is a composer and Professor in Computer Music at Plymouth University, UK, where he is Director of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research (ICCMR).

This is the first book to provide a detailed overview of prominent procedures of algorithmic composition in a pragmatic way rather than by treating formalizable aspects in single works. In addition to an historic overview, each chapter presents a specific class of algorithm in a compositional context by providing a general introduction to its development and theoretical basis and describes different musical applications. Each chapter outlines the strengths, weaknesses and possible aesthetical implications resulting from the application of the treated approaches. Topics covered are: markov models, generative grammars, transition networks, chaos and self-similarity, genetic algorithms, cellular automata, neural networks and artificial intelligence are covered. The comprehensive bibliography makes this work ideal for the musician and the researcher alike.",

        "description": "Tackling globalization is a great challenge – it is both extremely beneficial and essentially problematic. This comprehensive, multidisciplinary study confronts this ambivalence through the use of  computer simulation. It discusses the findings of social interaction and social simulation through the use of understandable global examples. Readers can use this book as a tool to outline significant aspects of intercultural simulation and highlight the issues that need to be considered in the reader’s analysis. The author leads the reader via sequential narration from a colloquial description of intercultural situations to final simulation prototypes; each step is accompanied by descriptive comments and program code. Social Interaction, Globalization and Computer-aided Analysis shows the reader how to acquire intercultural data from seemingly inconceivable information sources. Researchers and software developers engaged in interdisciplinary research projects in the field of Human-Computer Interaction will find this book to be a useful companion in their work. Alexander Osherenko is the founder of the start-up company Socioware Development, which implements psychologically-, sociologically- and culturally-aware software that scrutinizes information based on the findings of the cognitive sciences. Solutions created by Socioware Development can be implemented across a vast spectrum of industries, including car manufacturing, insurance and banking, Internet search engines and e-retailers.",

        "description": "The study of dynamic equations on a measure chain (time scale) goes back to its founder S. Hilger (1988), and is a new area of still fairly theoretical exploration in mathematics. Motivating the subject is the notion that dynamic equations on measure chains can build bridges between continuous and discrete mathematics. Further, the study of measure chain theory has led to several important applications, e.g., in the study of insect population models, neural networks, heat transfer, and epidemic models. Key features of the book: * Introduction to measure chain theory; discussion of its usefulness in allowing for the simultaneous development of differential equations and difference equations without having to repeat analogous proofs * Many classical formulas or procedures for differential and difference equations cast in a new light * New analogues of many of the 'special functions' studied * Examination of the properties of the 'exponential function' on time scales, which can be defined and investigated using a particularly simple linear equation * Additional topics covered: self-adjoint equations, linear systems, higher order equations, dynamic inequalities, and symplectic dynamic systems * Clear, motivated exposition, beginning with preliminaries and progressing to more sophisticated text * Ample examples and exercises throughout the book * Solutions to selected problems Requiring only a first semester of calculus and linear algebra, Dynamic Equations on Time Scales may be considered as an interesting approach to differential equations via exposure to continuous and discrete analysis. This approach provides an early encounter with many applications in such areas as biology, physics, and engineering. Parts of the book may be used in a special topics seminar at the senior undergraduate or beginning graduate levels. Finally, the work may",

With a foreword written by Joe Armstrong, this handbook offers an extensive tutorial for creating a state of the art Topology and Weight Evolving Artificial Neural Network (TWEANN) platform. In a step-by-step format, the reader is guided from a single simulated neuron to a complete system. By following these steps, the reader will be able to use novel technology to build a TWEANN system, which can be applied to Artificial Life simulation, and Forex trading. Because of Erlang’s architecture, it perfectly matches that of evolutionary and neurocomptational systems. As a programming language, it is a concurrent, message passing paradigm which allows the developers to make full use of the multi-core & multi-cpu systems.Handbook of Neuroevolution Through Erlangexplains how to leverage Erlang’s features in the field of machine learning, and the system’s real world applications, ranging from algorithmic financial trading to artificial life and robotics.",

SOC is the computing paradigm that uses Web services as building blocks for the engineering of composite, distributed applications out of the reusable application logic encapsulated by Web services. Web services could be considered the best-known and most standardized technology in use today for distributed computing over the Internet. Web Services Foundations is the first installment of a two-book collection covering the state-of-the-art of both theoretical and practical aspects of Web services and SOC research. This book specifically focuses on the foundations of Web services and SOC and covers - among others - Web service composition, non-functional aspects of Web services, Web service selection and recommendation, and assisted Web service composition. The editors collect advanced topics in the second book of the collection, Advanced Web Services, (Springer, 2013). Both books together comprise approximately 1400 pages and are the result of an enormous community effort that involved more than 100 authors, comprising the world’s leading experts in this field.",

        "description": "In the field of genetic and evolutionary algorithms (GEAs), much theory and empirical study has been heaped upon operators and test problems, but problem representation has often been taken as given. This monograph breaks with this tradition and studies a number of critical elements of a theory of representations for GEAs and applies them to the empirical study of various important idealized test functions and problems of commercial import. The book considers basic concepts of representations, such as redundancy, scaling and locality and describes how GEAs'performance is influenced. Using the developed theory representations can be analyzed and designed in a theory-guided manner.

It is also intended for individual study by students and professionals. The text does not assume familiarity with Mathematica nor does it require any prior programming experience. The book and diskette contain over 200 exercises drawn from many areas of science, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. The 3 1/2'' diskette included with this book can be read by UNIX, IBM-compatible, NeXT, and Macintosh computers. The diskette includes Notebooks and packages containing the code for all of the examples and exercises in the text, as well as additional material extending many of the ideas in the text. The packages will run on any computer running Mathematica and the Notebooks will run on any computer that supports Mathematica Notebooks. Version 2.0 or later of Mathematica is recommended for maximum use of the diskette.",

Hardly any critical enterprise solution comes without any functionality for managing data in its different forms. Web-Scale Data Management for the Cloud addresses fundamental challenges posed by the need and desire to provide database functionality in the context of the Database as a Service (DBaaS) paradigm for database outsourcing. This book also discusses the motivation of the new paradigm of cloud computing, and its impact to data outsourcing and service-oriented computing in data-intensive applications. Techniques with respect to the support in the current cloud environments, major challenges, and future trends are covered in the last section of this book. A survey addressing the techniques and special requirements for building database services are provided in this book as well.",

Respected scholars stimulate the debate on the most distinctive and controversial views he defended, and present the philosophy of information as a specific way of doing philosophy. Contains eight essays by leading scholars, a reply by Luciano Floridi, and an epilogue by Terrell W. Bynum. Explains the importance of philosophy of information as a specific way of doing philosophy. Focuses directly on the work of Luciano Floridi in the area of philosophy of information, but also connects to contemporary concerns in philosophy more generally. Illustrates several debates that arise from core themes in the philosophy of information.'-- 'The philosophy of information is the area concerned with the critical investigation of the nature and principles of information. This includes its dynamics, its use, especially as far as ethical issues are concerned, and the application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems. The core aim of this volume is to present the philosophy of information as a specific way of doing philosophy. It focuses on the contributions of Luciano Floridi, and stimulates the debate on the most distinctive and controversial views he defended. This challenge is taken up by leading and upcoming scholars who work in areas related to the philosophy of information, and includes a reply from Floridi. Although the volume focuses directly on the work of Floridi in the philosophy of information, it also connects to contemporary concerns in philosophy, especially in logic, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, epistemology and ethics. This volume is sure to have a concrete and lasting influence by engaging the area of the Philosophy of Information with the philosophical community at large.'--",

In this book the contributing authors demonstrate both general-purpose algorithms and those aimed at solving specialized application problems, with a special emphasis on heuristic iterative optimization methods employing modern evolutionary and swarm intelligence based techniques. The applications considered are in domains such as communications engineering, estimation and tracking, digital filter design, wireless sensor networks, bioelectric signal classification, image denoising, and image feature tracking.   The book presents interesting, state-of-the-art methodologies for solving real-world problems and it is a suitable reference for researchers and engineers in the areas of heuristics and signal processing.",

        "description": "This edited volume provides insights into and tools for the modeling, analysis, optimization, and control of large-scale networks in the life sciences and in engineering. Large-scale systems are often the result of networked interactions between a large number of subsystems, and their analysis and control are becoming increasingly important. The chapters of this book present the basic concepts and theoretical foundations of network theory and discuss its applications in different scientific areas such as biochemical reactions, chemical production processes, systems biology, electrical circuits, and mobile agents. The aim is to identify common concepts, to understand the underlying mathematical ideas, and to inspire discussions across the borders of the various disciplines.  The book originates from the interdisciplinary summer school “Large Scale Networks in Engineering and Life Sciences” hosted by the International Max Planck Research School Magdeburg, September 26-30, 2011, and will therefore be of interest to mathematicians, engineers, physicists, biologists, chemists, and anyone involved in the network sciences. In particular, due to their introductory nature the chapters can serve individually or as a whole as the basis of graduate courses and seminars, future summer schools, or as reference material for practitioners in the network sciences.",

Communities are generally hierarchical, overlapping, multi-scale and coexist with other types of structural regularities of networks. This poses major challenges for conventional methods of community detection. This book will comprehensively introduce the latest advances in community detection, especially the detection of overlapping and hierarchical community structures, the detection of multi-scale communities in heterogeneous networks, and the exploration of multiple types of structural regularities. These advances have been successfully applied to analyze large-scale online social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. This book provides readers a convenient way to grasp the cutting edge of community detection in complex networks.The thesis on which this book is based was honored with the “Top 100 Excellent Doctoral Dissertations Award” from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was nominated as the “Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation” by the Chinese Computer Federation.",

        "description": "This book is devoted to recent progress made in solving propositional satisfiability and related problems. Propositional satisfiability is a powerful and general formalism used to solve a wide range of important problems including hardware and software verification. The core of many reasoning problems in automated deduction are propositional. Research into methods to automate such reasoning has therefore a long history in artificial intelligence. In 1957, Allen Newell and Herb Simon introduced the Logic Theory Machine to prove propositional theorems from Whitehead and Russel's 'Principia mathematica'. In 1960, Martin Davis and Hillary Putnam introduced their eponymous decision procedure for satisfiability reasoning (though, for space reasons, it was quickly superseded by the modified procedure proposed by Martin Davis, George Logemann and Donald Loveland two years later). In 1971, Stephen Cook's proof that propositional satisfiability is NP-Complete placed satisfiability as the cornerstone of complexity theory. As this volume demonstrates, research has continued very actively in this area since then. This book follows on from the highly successful volume entitled SAT 2000 published five years ago. The papers in SAT 2005 fall (not entirely neatly) into the following categories: complete methods, local and stochastic search methods, random problems, applications, and extensions beyond the propositional.",

        "description": "Computational semantics is concerned with computing the meanings of linguistic objects such as sentences, text fragments, and dialogue contributions. As such it is the interdisciplinary child of semantics, the study of meaning and its linguistic encoding, and computational linguistics, the discipline that is concerned with computations on linguistic objects. From one parent computational semantics inherits concepts and techniques that have been developed under the banner of formal (or model-theoretic) semantics. This blend of logic and linguistics applies the methods of logic to the description of meaning. From the other parent the young discipline inherits methods and techniques for parsing sentences, for effective and efficient representation of syntactic structure and logical form, and for reasoning with semantic information. Computational semantics integrates and further develops these methods, concepts and techniques. This book is a collection of papers written by outstanding researchers in the newly emerging field of computational semantics. It is aimed at those linguists, computer scientists, and logicians who want to know more about the algorithmic realisation of meaning in natural language and about what is happening in this field of research. There is a general introduction by the editors.",

The 'subsystems of second order arithmetic' provide the basic formal systems normally used in our current understanding of the logical structure of classical mathematics. Simpson provides an encyclopedic treatment of these systems with an emphasis onHilbert's program(where infinitary mathematics is to be secured or reinterpreted by finitary mathematics), and the emergingreverse mathematics(where axioms necessary for providing theorems are determined by deriving axioms from theorems). The classical mathematical topics treated in these axiomatic terms are very diverse, and include standard topics in complete separable metric spaces and Banach spaces, countable groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces, ordinary differential equations, fixed points, infinite games, Ramsey theory, and many others. The material, with its many open problems and detailed references to the literature, is particularly valuable for proof theorists and recursion theorists. The book is both suitable for the beginning graduate student in mathematical logic, and encyclopedic for the expert.' Harvey Friedman, Ohio State University.",

        "description": "In this book, hierarchical structures based on neural networks are investigated for automatic speech recognition. These structures are evaluated on the phoneme recognition task where a  Hybrid Hidden Markov Model/Artificial Neural Network paradigm is used. The baseline hierarchical scheme consists of two levels each which is based on a Multilayered Perceptron. Additionally, the output of the first level serves as a second level input. The computational speed of the phoneme recognizer can be substantially increased by removing redundant information still contained at the first level output. Several techniques based on temporal and phonetic criteria have been investigated to remove this redundant information. The computational time could be reduced by 57% whilst keeping the system accuracy comparable to the baseline hierarchical approach.",

Beyond classical application fields, like approximation, combinatorial optimization, graphics, and operations research, graph algorithms have recently attracted increased attention from computational molecular biology and computational chemistry. Centered around the fundamental issue of graph isomorphism, this text goes beyond classical graph problems of shortest paths, spanning trees, flows in networks, and matchings in bipartite graphs. Advanced algorithmic results and techniques of practical relevance are presented in a coherent and consolidated way. This book introduces graph algorithms on an intuitive basis followed by a detailed exposition in a literate programming style, with correctness proofs as well as worst-case analyses. Furthermore, full C++ implementations of all algorithms presented are given using the LEDA library of efficient data structures and algorithms. Numerous illustrations, examples, and exercises, and a comprehensive bibliography support students and professionals in using the book as a text and source of reference.",

Understanding Computation explains theoretical computer science in a context you’ll recognize, helping you appreciate why these ideas matter and how they can inform your day-to-day programming. Rather than use mathematical notation or an unfamiliar academic programming language like Haskell or Lisp, this book uses Ruby in a reductionist manner to present formal semantics, automata theory, and functional programming with the lambda calculus. It’s ideal for programmers versed in modern languages, with little or no formal training in computer science. Understand fundamental computing concepts, such as Turing completeness in languagesDiscover how programs use dynamic semantics to communicate ideas to machinesExplore what a computer can do when reduced to its bare essentialsLearn how universal Turing machines led to today’s general-purpose computersPerform complex calculations, using simple languages and cellular automataDetermine which programming language features are essential for computationExamine how halting and self-referencing make some computing problems unsolvableAnalyze programs by using abstract interpretation and type systems",

While there has been a lot of interest from mathematicians, physicists and engineers in DGM, only scattered information is available and there has been no prior effect in organizing and publishing the existing volume of knowledge on this subject. The current volume organizes this knowledge and it covers both theoretical as well as practical issues of the Discontinuous Galerkin method.",

It shows how CP-nets have been developed, from being a promising theoretical model to being a full-fledged language for the design, specification, simulation, validation and implementation of large software systems. The book contains the formal definition of CP-nets and the mathematical theory behind their analysis methods. The book is also intended to attract readers who are more interested in applications than in the underlying mathematics, and a large part of the book is written in a style which is closer to an engineering textbook or a user manual than a typical textbook in theoretical computer science. The book consists of three separate volumes. The first volume defines the net model and the basic concepts. It gives a detailed presentation of many small examples and a brief overview ofsome industrial applications. It introduces the formal analysis methods. Finally, it contains a description of a set of CP-net tools which support the practical use of CP-nets. Most of the material in this volume is application oriented. Its purpose is to teach the reader how to construct CP-net models and analyse them by means of simulation.",

Using the latest research and driven by practical experience from industry, this book gives useful hints to practitioners on how to write and structure requirements. - Explains the importance of Systems Engineering and the creation of effective solutions to problems - Describes the underlying representations used in system modeling - data flow diagrams; statecharts; object-oriented approaches - Covers a generic multi-layer requirements process - Discusses the key elements of effective requirements management - Includes a chapter written by one of the developers of rich traceability - Introduces an overview of DOORS - a software tool which serves as an enabler of a requirements management process Additional material and links are available at:http://www.requirementsengineering.info'In recent years we have been finding ourselves with a shortage of engineers with good competence in requirements engineering. Perhaps this is in part because requirements management tool vendors have persuaded management that a glitzy tool will solve their requirements engineering problems. Of course, the tools only make it possible for engineers who understand requirements engineering to do a better job. This book goes a long way towards building a foundational set of skills in requirements engineering, so that today's powerful tools can be used sensibly. Of particular value is a recognition of the place software requirements have within the system context, and of ways for dealing with that sensitive connection. This is an important book. I think its particular value in industry will be to bring the requirements engineers and their internal customers to a practical common understanding of what can and should be achieved.'

This book also provides an introduction to standard finite element approximations, followed by the construction of elements for the approximation of mixed formulations in H(div) and H(curl). The general theory is applied to some classical examples: Dirichlet's problem, Stokes' problem,  plate problems, elasticity and electromagnetism.",

        "description": "This book gathers together, in a new way, established and contemporary thinking about how to get the best out of information technology and information systems investments.  Working managers who are beset by the complexities of information management in the age of Big Data and the Social Web, and students who are trying to make sense of information management in a chaotic world that is more and more driven by the Internet, will all benefit from this new treatment of a long-standing and problematic domain.  Importantly, the book reveals and clarifies the dependencies that exist between the inner world of information technology and the outer world of people and organisations at work.  The book differs from other books in its reflective approach.  It avoids lengthy, descriptive, and prescriptive dogma.  Rather, it provides tools for thinking about information management and it identifies strategic and tactical options at six levels:  from the simple consideration of information technology and information systems, right through to issues of organisational performance and business strategy. At the heart of the matter are two critical and tightly connected issues:  the ways that we conceive and manage an organisation’s processes, and the ways that we conceive and manage the information that an organisation needs to sustain those processes.  The six-level framework that achieves this clarity is the “Information Management Body of Knowledge” (familiarly known as the “IMBOK”).  This easy-to-understand and easy-to-remember framework has been found to be extremely useful in business, in government, in civil society and in education.   Throughout the book, selected research papers are identified and summarised.  There are also summary chapters from three different operational perspectives:  performance and competency assessment using the IMBOK, undertaking research into related issues, and a review of parallel expert thinking.  This book stands as a reference point and resource for all those who need to straddle the disparate worlds of “information technology” and “business”.  It provides firm pedagogical foundations for courses dealing with business management in the information age, and it provides a sound reference framework for researchers who need to position research projects related to information technology and information systems in a wider context.  For busy managers, who simply wish to identify, understand and successfully manage information technology-related opportunities, it provides an ideal arrangement of ideas and tools that will help them.",

        "description": "Possibly the most comprehensive overview of computer graphics as seen in the context of geometric modelling, this two volume work covers implementation and theory in a thorough and systematic fashion. Computer Graphics and Geometric Modelling: Mathematics, contains the mathematical background needed for the geometric modeling topics in computer graphics covered in the first volume. This volume begins with material from linear algebra and a discussion of the transformations in affine & projective geometry, followed by topics from advanced calculus & chapters on general topology, combinatorial topology, algebraic topology, differential topology, differential geometry, and finally algebraic geometry. Two important goals throughout were to explain the material thoroughly, and to make it self-contained. This volume by itself would make a good mathematics reference book, in particular for practitioners in the field of geometric modelling. Due to its broad coverage and emphasis on explanation it could be used as a text for introductory mathematics courses on some of the covered topics, such as topology (general, combinatorial, algebraic, and differential) and geometry (differential & algebraic).",

        "description": "This text covers the fundamental issues of developing programs for scientific computation on concurrent computers. Its purpose is to construct a conceptual framework that is a basis for understanding the real issues of concurrency. The core problems are often buried by mountains of technical detail. The conceptual framework allows us to cut through non-issues. It is, therefore, a basis for developing new numerical methods and new software tools that solve the real problems. Anyone who wishes to use concurrent computers should benefit from this text. Because the book covers numerical algorithms, an elementary background of linear algebra and advanced calculus is required. A previous contact with structured programming techniques will be helpful. The level of the text is aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students and researchers. The few sections that contain more advanced mathematical material can be omitted upon a first reading of the book. All algorithms are developed in detail, in a unified notation, and according to a coherent methodology. This is not an encyclopedia of recipes. Rather, the book stresses the methodology behind developing one's own concurrent programs for scientific computing. The approach is new because the text introduces formal program development to scientific computing. Readers can expect to cut down the time needed to develop concurrent programs. By following the same methodology, the user's programs will be easier to integrate into libraries, easier to use, and portable to a wide variety of concurrent computers.",

        "description": "Since the publication of the companion volume Researching Learning in Virtual Worlds in 2010, there has been a growth not only in the range and number of educational initiatives taking place in virtual worlds, but also in the depth of analysis of the nature of that education. Understanding Learning in Virtual Worlds reflects those changes through a collection of chapters that are extended versions of research presented at the second Researching Learning in Virtual Environments conference (ReLIVE 11), an international conference hosted by the Open University UK. Included in this book are chapters that explore the philosophical and methodological underpinnings of understanding learning in virtual worlds, identify and analyse the factors that support learning in these environments, and present case studies that demonstrate some of the various ways in which virtual worlds can be applied to facilitate learning and teaching. The links between learning in a virtual world and learning in the physical world are made apparent throughout, and the authors reveal how understanding learning in one informs the other. Understanding Learning in Virtual Worlds is an important book not only to those who teach in virtual worlds, but to anyone for whom understanding learning, in all its forms, is of interest.",

The authors introduce the main topics through the fundamentals of abstract semigroup theory and significant research results concerning its application to concrete semigroups of matrices. The material is suitable for a two-semester graduate course on weak convergence and random walks. It is assumed that the student will have a background in Probability Theory, Measure Theory, and Group Theory.",

Thirty beautiful examples are presented here. They are candidates for The Book in which God records the perfect proofs - according to the late Paul Erdös, who himself suggested many of the topics in this collection. The result is a book which will be fun for everybody with an interest in mathematics, requiring only a very modest (undergraduate) mathematical background. For this revised and expanded second edition several chapters have been revised and expanded, and three new chapters have been added.",

This book examines new algorithms and tools, technology platforms and reconfigurable technologies for cybersecurity systems. Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are explored as a key component of any general network intrusion detection service, complementing signature-based IDS components by attempting to identify novel attacks.  These attacks  may not yet be known or have well-developed signatures.  Methods are also suggested to simplify the construction of metrics in such a manner that they retain their ability to effectively cluster data, while simultaneously easing human interpretation of outliers. This is a professional book for practitioners or government employees working in cybersecurity, and can also be used as a reference.  Advanced-level students in computer science or electrical engineering studying security will also find this book useful .",

        "description": "Reinforcement learning is the learning of a mapping from situations to actions so as to maximize a scalar reward or reinforcement signal. The learner is not told which action to take, as in most forms of machine learning, but instead must discover which actions yield the highest reward by trying them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward, but also the next situation, and through that all subsequent rewards. These two characteristics -- trial-and-error search and delayed reward -- are the most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is both a new and a very old topic in AI. The term appears to have been coined by Minsk (1961), and independently in control theory by Walz and Fu (1965). The earliest machine learning research now viewed as directly relevant was Samuel's (1959) checker player, which used temporal-difference learning to manage delayed reward much as it is used today. Of course learning and reinforcement have been studied in psychology for almost a century, and that work has had a very strong impact on the AI/engineering work. One could in fact consider all of reinforcement learning to be simply the reverse engineering of certain psychological learning processes (e.g. operant conditioning and secondary reinforcement). Reinforcement Learning is an edited volume of original research, comprising seven invited contributions by leading researchers.",

The social science literature on culture, human collaboration and negotiation is mostly devoted to work within the same culture. Computer science and Artificial intelligence researchers have developed computational models of cooperation, conflict resolution and negotiation without paying a great deal of attention to identifying and modelling cultural factors. The interest in understanding inter-cultural interactions has increased substantially and has led to greater interest of social scientists and computational scientists in theoretical and experimental analysis of inter-cultural exchanges, modelling and support. The aim of this volume is to bridge the gap and bring these communities together to share research work and experiences, discuss ideas and forge interdisciplinary collaborative relations.",

        "description": "The patterns on the shells of tropical sea snails are not only compellingly beautiful but also tell a tale of biological development. The decorative patterns are records of their own genesis, which follows laws like those of dune formation or the spread of a flu epidemic. Hans Meinhardt has analyzed the dynamical processes that form these patterns and retraced them faithfully in computer simulations. His book is exciting not only for the astonishing scientific knowledge it reveals but also for its fascinating pictures. Many of the simulations are supplied on the accompanying CD-ROM in HTML format. Thus, the highly dynamic behavior of the interactions on which shell patterning is based can be inspected like conventional websites with any browser, also on a Macintosh or Linux system. The animations are given as separate files that also can be integrated, e.g., into a PowerPoint presentation if desired. Also included are animated simulations of models that describe more general problems in the development of higher organisms, e.g., formation of organizing regions, pattern formation in hydra, gene activation, formation of net-like structures, and chemotactic orientation.",
